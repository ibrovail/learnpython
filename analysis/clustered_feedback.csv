•  Create repository of local TLM SMEs to validate information quickly without needing to hunt down info centrally,4,"This cluster is about: needing, smes, local, information, and tlm."

"• Seek more clarification on asks, especillay on the language",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
"• a lot of time buffer build for delays and to get right partner involvement, align with partner before the process starts to get SMEs,",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
"• plan for Plan B, Plan C and start working on it well in advance,",5,"This cluster is about: plan, advance, timelines, smes, and process."
"• hold different teams accountable on timelines, need dedicated Project Management just for TLM as there could be other elements for a project that need to be taken care of by ICS business teams, escalate very ealry on",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• Identify TLMs in other markets to align TLM requirements and identify efficiencies,1,"This cluster is about: identify, markets, tlms, efficiencies, and align."
"• Business teams who are subject matter experts in these areas could proactively provide input into these questions. Eg. If co-brand partners do need to complete Amex training, a contact outside of the product team should be aware and be flagging this or providing the necessary training, or information to us to share with our partners proactively vs us needing to provide this information retroactively to meet TLM standards.",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• Setting expectations with the partner and providing clear communication ahead of time on what will be required.,0,"This cluster is about: ahead, setting, communication, clear, and expectations."
• Understanding based on the questions/requirements who needs to be involved in order to provide this information to the partner to have time to prep and bring their stakeholders along,2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• Opportunities to consolidate any work throughout the TLM journey when it comes to information required from a partner.,2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• Setting expectations with the partner and providing clear communication ahead of time on what will be required,0,"This cluster is about: ahead, setting, communication, clear, and expectations."
• Bringing our teams along and providing as much information on the process with details in order for us to share requirements coming down the pipeline so the partner is able to prepare and set capacity appropriately,2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
"• Clear breakdown and summary to be documented to understand all of the pillars, rationale, requirements, process, what they mean, etc.",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• One on one discussions and in person/Webex connects with relationship managers on what is expected of them vs just communicating over email.,2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• Identify TLMs in other markets to align TLM requirements and identify efficiencies,1,"This cluster is about: identify, markets, tlms, efficiencies, and align."
"• Since PRA questionnaires are generic, CA should have a 'cheat sheet' owned by local CA Privacy team that allows us to easily populate fields that don't vary from project to project",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
"• Condensed ""how-to guide"" that clearly outlines the expectations for different questions in the PRA questionnaire and how local marketing teams who are not privacy SMEs are expected to answer these questions",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• Access to previous CA PRAs to allow sharing of best practices and leveraging how questions were answered for similar CA projects,2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
• Level set with central teams on local market regulatory requirements and incremental governance processes so as to secure support in advance,2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
"• If there is a standard process to engage key SMEs in advance of kickoffs, plan timelines and engagement accordingly",5,"This cluster is about: plan, advance, timelines, smes, and process."
"• Collaborate with Central and Local OE on what are all of the governance workstreams (PPCR, AEMP54, ABC007 etc) that are required for each type of project (i.e. NPA; Decommission; New capability) and the associated timelines.",3,"This cluster is about: workstreams, central, oe, etc, and npa."
• Identify parallel workstreams that need to take place (but not owned by governance) and the respective contacts and timelines so that teams are aware of other workstreams that impact approvals and can work in parallel to ensure full completeness of review and approvals,2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
"• Evaluate the NPA process, identify bottlenecks/challenges as they come up and share with the OE team so they can support where applicable",2,"This cluster is about: teams, partner, questions, ca, and process."
