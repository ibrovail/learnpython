THESIS REVIEW SUMMARY

### Portfolio Strategy: Diversified Catalyst Capture with Sector Hedge

**Week 20 positioning rationale:** The portfolio transitions from pure biotech catalyst concentration to a more balanced four-position structure spanning two distinct sectors. The addition of PESI (nuclear waste, beta 0.38) creates meaningful diversification against the biotech binary events in VNDA and RCKT. With KOD stopped out and HDSN's DLA contract rescinded, risk management becomes paramount as the portfolio enters a decisive three-week stretch.

### Individual Position Theses

**HDSN (Clean Tech Anchor — 19.8%, conviction MODERATE ⬇):** Thesis weakened by DLA contract rescission but not invalidated. The $210M contract was a key pillar but not the sole thesis driver. Existing contract continues through July 2026 maintaining revenue continuity. Bid protests are common in government contracting — Hudson has been prime contractor since 2016. Supporting thesis elements remain intact: $40M buyback active through 2026, CARB REFRESH pilot selection (one of two reclaimers for California program), Refrigerants Inc. acquisition expanding geographic footprint, $89.7M cash with zero debt, and HFC pricing tailwinds. Key risks elevated: Brian Coleman insider sales ($3.59M) and resignation, $100M shelf registration overhang. Q4 earnings March 10-11 will be the critical test of new CEO execution and DLA commentary. Conviction downgraded from HIGH to MODERATE pending resolution.

**VNDA (Core Biotech — 32.5%, conviction HIGH):** Highest conviction position approaching its defining catalyst. **THESIS CORRECTION:** Bysanti (milsaperidone) targets bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia via 505(b)(2) pathway — NOT gastroparesis as previously documented. The 505(b)(2) pathway based on bioequivalence to already-approved iloperidone (Fanapt) represents a relatively lower-risk regulatory path than novel compound reviews. Feb 21 PDUFA is 20 days away. Commercial revenue base ($210-230M FY25) from three marketed drugs (Fanapt, HETLIOZ, PONVORY) provides fundamental floor even on CRL. NEREUS approved Dec 30, 2025 for motion sickness — first new treatment in 40+ years — adds commercial optionality. Tradipitant Phase 2 positive for GLP-1 nausea creates potential blockbuster angle (H1 2026 Phase 3 start). Imsidolimab BLA filed December 2025 for pustular psoriasis provides mid-2026 catalyst. Ponesimod advanced into Phase 3 psoriasis study (Jan 23, 2026). HETLIOZ jet lag sNDA rejection (Jan 8) absorbed — HC Wainwright called it "only minor setback." $293.8M cash with 2.5-3+ year runway. Analyst consensus $13.63 (+81% upside).

**RCKT (Speculative Catalyst — 16.1%, conviction MODERATE):** Binary bet on March 28 PDUFA with favorable setup. Prior June 2024 CRL was explicitly CMC-only — FDA did not question safety or efficacy data showing 100% patient survival at 12 months. No advisory committee meeting required, reducing process risk. Kresladi addresses LAD-I, a near-uniformly fatal childhood disease with no approved gene therapy alternative. PRV (~$150M value) provides meaningful non-dilutive funding if approved. Cash position $222.8M with runway into Q2 2027. Analyst price targets range $3-11 with consensus ~$8-12 on approval. Key risk: CMC issues may resurface or FDA may request additional manufacturing data, leading to another CRL. Position sized at 16.1% to limit downside while capturing asymmetric upside.

**PESI (Nuclear/Environmental Diversifier — 18.8%, conviction MODERATE):** New position providing critical sector diversification. Nuclear waste remediation niche benefits from secular tailwinds: nuclear renaissance for AI data center power, DOE/DOD spending increases, and PFAS regulation expansion. January 9, 2026 Richland permit expansion approximately triples liquid mixed waste capacity — directly addresses revenue-constraining bottleneck. PFAS commercialization via Enforcer One distribution agreement (Dec 4, 2025) opens addressable market. UK framework contract (up to £41M over 4 years) provides international diversification. Low beta (0.38) is uncorrelated with biotech holdings. Key risks: negative EBITDA (-$10.3M), near 52-week highs ($15.27 vs $16.50 high), thin volume (138K avg daily), government shutdown dependency. Craig-Hallum $20 target (+31% upside). Earnings March 19, 2026 will reveal Richland/Hanford contribution.

### Risk Budget Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Max drawdown if all stops hit | ~$53 (HDSN $11 + VNDA $22 + RCKT $9 + PESI $11) = -16.3% from equity |
| Probability of simultaneous stops | <3% — Positions span 3 uncorrelated sectors |
| Expected 4-week portfolio range | $275 - $425 depending on VNDA PDUFA outcome |
| Best case (VNDA approved + RCKT on track) | Portfolio potentially $380-420 (+17-29%) |
| Worst case (VNDA CRL + sector selloff) | Portfolio $275-295 (-9-15%) with stops limiting further damage |
| Key week | Feb 16-21 (VNDA PDUFA week — single largest event risk) |

### KOD Re-Entry — Active Conditional Order Placed

Kodiak Sciences recovered to ~$26 after our $24.50 stop-out. GLOW2 Phase 3 topline data expected Q1 2026 (imminent). KSI-101 MESI data presentation February 7 at Angiogenesis conference. UBS initiated with $50 PT; HC Wainwright $38 PT. December 2025 offering at $23/share extended runway. Baker Brothers increased position 16.5%. 

**Conditional order placed:** 1 share at $24.25 limit (GTC), stop $22.00/$21.90 if filled. Scaled to 1 share to preserve cash discipline while maintaining exposure to GLOW2 binary catalyst. Market cap ($1.6B) exceeds $500M threshold — exception granted. Order will be cancelled if GLOW2 readout occurs before fill to avoid entering after binary event.

### Next Week Priorities
1. Confirm PESI order fill Monday February 2
2. Monitor KOD conditional order at $24.25 — cancel if GLOW2 data releases before fill
3. Monitor HDSN for DLA protest resolution developments
4. Begin VNDA pre-PDUFA exit planning (target completion by Feb 18)
5. Track KOD KSI-101 Feb 7 data presentation
6. Watch XBI/biotech sentiment ahead of Eli Lilly earnings Feb 5
