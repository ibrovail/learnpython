# Thesis Review Summary

Our portfolio remains a mix of uncorrelated, catalyst-driven small-caps aimed at outsized alpha. Biotech positions (ATRA, ANIX, FBIO) each have independent binary or data events: ATRA’s FDA (Jan 2026\) and Fortress’s Cutx-101 FDA (Jan 14), plus Anixa’s positive early trial. These trades are funded by reining in SGML (excess concentration now) and minor trimming. In climate/clean-tech, HDSN’s reliable regulation-driven growth and Aemetis’s efficiency upgrades anchor the theme. FCEL remains a speculative energy play with long-term backlog but we’ve kept it small. Sigma Lithium is still held for the ongoing lithium supercycle, but position size is reduced. After these adjustments, risk is balanced across themes. We remain vigilant on stop-losses: all positions have fresh stops. The next week’s focus is on ATRA’s FDA decision and any FDA/newsflow for FBIO; otherwise we will monitor each thesis and be ready to act on any confirmed catalyst.
