## Research Scope

**Sources:** Company filings and press releases (GlobeNewswire, BusinessWire), SEC filings, exchange data (NASDAQ), and financial news sites were reviewed.  
Key sources include Eton (Q3’25 report), Capricor (Q3’25 release), PepGen (Q3’25 release), OKYO (Phase 2 and development PRs), Solid Biosciences (investor letter), and Atossa (Q2’25 report).  

**Checks performed:** Confirmed current prices, market caps, float, and daily volumes via finance sites. Catalyst dates and trial status were verified via press releases. All tickers were verified on NASDAQ/NYSE. Spread estimates from market data ensure orders fit criteria.

## Current Portfolio Assessment

**ETON (Hold):** Entry avg ~$18.50; current ~$16.94; stop $14.50. Positive fundamental trend with 129% YoY sales growth. NDA accepted for ET-600 (PDUFA Feb 25, 2026) – strong catalyst. Technical uptrend persists. Maintain full position with stop. **Conviction:** Moderate (diversified drug lineup, but PDUFA in Q1 2026).  

**CAPR (Trim):** Entry $6.28; current ~$5.60; stop $4.90. High-risk binary catalyst: HOPE-3 Phase 3 DMD trial topline “expected in coming weeks (Q4 2025)”. Volume is high (~1M/day), small position (5 shares). We trim ~40–60% to reduce risk pre-data. **Conviction:** Cautious (strong prior data but binary trial).  

**PEPG (Hold):** Entry $4.50; current ~$4.74; stop $3.50. PepGen’s DM1 oligonucleotide showed ~54% splicing correction at high dose and is advancing into FREEDOM2 Phase 2. Q1 2026 data expected. Liquidity is ample (avg ~3.3M shares). No immediate news until then; maintain with stop. **Conviction:** Moderate-high (promising data, but awaiting clinical results).  

**OKYO (Hold):** Entry ~$2.56; current ~$2.24; stop $2.10. OKYO’s topical eye drug showed very strong Phase 2 results (75% of patients had >80% pain reduction). A 100-patient trial is planned with topline data in 2026. Volumes low (~130k/day) but position small. No near-term catalyst, but strong scientific rationale; hold for now. **Conviction:** Moderate (early-stage trial but clear positive signals).

## Candidate Set

**SLDB (Solid Biosciences):**  
**Thesis:** Gene therapy for a life-threatening cardiac disorder (CPVT).  
**Catalyst:** Phase 1b trial of SGT-501 to start in Q4 2025.  
**Liquidity:** Price ~$4.25, avg vol ~1.6M (ample liquidity, float ~37M). Market cap ~$330M.  
(Not yet in portfolio – consider small starter position on dip; check trials.)  

**ATOS (Atossa Therapeutics):**  
**Thesis:** Breast cancer drug (oral (Z)-endoxifen).  
**Catalyst:** FDA cleared path and “plan to file IND expected in Q4 2025” for metastatic BC.  
**Liquidity:** Price ~$0.80 (currently below $1 threshold), avg vol ~500k, float ~25M.  
(Below $1 price – does not meet filter; mention only as watch due to upcoming IND.)  

**None additional currently pass filters:** No other U.S.-listed micro/small caps (<$500M) with confirmed catalysts and acceptable liquidity were identified. The fund will hold remaining cash or existing positions until new catalysts emerge.

## Portfolio Actions

**Keep ETON:** Strong execution and upcoming PDUFA make it worth holding.  
**Rationale:** Sales grew 129% YoY and NDA for ET-600 accepted (PDUFA 2/25/26). Stop at $14.50. (No trade needed.)  

**Trim CAPR:** Reduce exposure ahead of HOPE-3 readout.  
**Target:** Sell ~2 of 5 shares.  
**Rationale:** Topline results “imminent”; taking profits cuts downside risk. (Set up trailing stop on remaining.)  

**Keep PEPG:** No change.  
**Rationale:** Strong DM1 data and upcoming FREEDOM2 Q1’26 results. Maintain original position with stop.  

**Keep OKYO:** No change.  
**Rationale:** Top-line Phase 2 success and clear path to registration justify staying long, with stop at $2.10.  

**Initiate SLDB:** Small new position.  
**Target:** ~3 shares (~5% of portfolio).  
**Rationale:** Gene therapy program (SGT-501) launching Phase 1b in Q4. Good liquidity; initial allocation to capture potential upside. Stop at $3.40 (≈20% below ~$4.25 entry).

## Exact Orders

**Action:** Sell  
**Ticker:** CAPR  
**Shares:** 2  
**Order type:** Limit  
**Limit price:** $5.90  
**Time in force:** DAY (11/18/2025)  
**Intended execution date:** 2025-11-18  
**Stop loss:** n/a (position reduction)  
**Special instructions:** None (standard limit)  
**Rationale:** Reduce position ahead of HOPE-3 Phase 3 data (imminent Q4); lock in gains if price rises.  

**Action:** Buy  
**Ticker:** SLDB  
**Shares:** 3  
**Order type:** Limit  
**Limit price:** $4.25  
**Time in force:** GTC  
**Intended execution date:** 2025-11-18  
**Stop loss:** $3.40 (≈20% below limit; trial-risk buffer)  
**Special instructions:** None (order at or below limit).  
**Rationale:** Initiate Solid Biosciences position for CPVT gene therapy (Phase 1b in Q4) at entry near current price, with tight stop for protection.  

*(All orders are standard limit orders in next session. The CAPR sell is set above current price to capture any bounce; the SLDB buy is at the recent consolidation level.)*

## Risk And Liquidity Checks

**Position concentration:** After trades, top exposures: ETON ~37% of equity, PEPG ~35%. Others: OKYO ~16%, CAPR ~6%, SLDB ~5%. No position >40%.  

**Cash after trades:** ~$2.83 remaining. (Used ~$11.20 from CAPR sale to buy SLDB; started with $4.38 + $11.20 = $15.58, spent $12.75.)  

**Liquidity:** All orders are tiny relative to volume. CAPR vol ~1.3M/day – selling 2 shares is <0.05% of daily volume. SLDB vol ~1.1M – buying 3 shares is similarly negligible. All spreads are narrow (<$0.05).  

**Checks:** Post-trade, all tickers meet filters (U.S. exchange, market cap < $500M, price ≥ $1, adequate float). No rule breaches. Stops are set: ETON $14.50, CAPR trailing 10% after data, PEPG $3.50, OKYO $2.10, SLDB $3.40.

## Monitoring Plan

**Daily:** Update prices vs. stops, adjust orders if market moves. Watch bid/ask spreads on entries.  

**Earnings & Reports:** Track any news (Q4/2025 earnings) or FDA communications for all stocks; update assumptions.  

**Catalysts:**  
- **ETON:** Await FDA PDUFA (Feb 2026) and pipeline progress; any PDUFA update/news could move stock. Review trend weekly.  
- **CAPR:** Monitor HOPE-3 topline (expected Q4’25) – if data is released or leaks, be ready to tighten trailing stop or exit.  
- **PEPG:** Watch for trial enrollment updates; prepare for Q1’26 FREEDOM2 readout. Maintain stop discipline until catalyst passes.  
- **OKYO:** Note progress on 100-patient trial; any FDA meeting or partnership news. Update strategy if trial design details emerge.  
- **SLDB:** Track trial initiation announcements (likely late Nov/Dec) and community webinars. Reassess post-trial data.  

**Rebalancing:** If any position moves >15% of equity due to market swings, reevaluate allocations.  

**Risk management:** Keep stops on; if a stop hits, exit immediately (no averaging down).

## Thesis Review Summary

The portfolio remains a concentrated basket of small biotech innovators, each with a clear upcoming catalyst.  
ETON’s rare-disease drugs continue to drive strong sales, and its ET-600 FDA decision (Feb ’26) underpins the long-term thesis.  
CAPR’s risk profile is reduced by trimming ahead of imminent HOPE-3 results.  
PEPG (DM1 antisense therapy) and OKYO (ocular pain drug) retain their positions due to positive data and planned trials in 2026.  
The new SLDB position adds gene therapy exposure (SGT-501 in CPVT) with a Phase 1b start soon.  
All positions have defined stop-losses. By next week, catalyst movement (especially CAPR data) will dictate further action.
