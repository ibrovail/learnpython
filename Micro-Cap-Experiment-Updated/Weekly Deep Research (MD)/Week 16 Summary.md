**Thesis Review Summary:**

*After this week’s adjustments, our portfolio is concentrated in high-alpha catalysts while still respecting diversification and risk.* We have essentially two strategy sleeves: **biotech catalyst plays** and **clean tech value plays**, each comprising roughly half the portfolio. Here’s a recap of our thesis for each and what to watch next:

* **Biotech Catalyst Sleeve (ATRA, FBIO, AQST):** We hold three small biotech positions, all with *imminent FDA decisions* that are independent of general market moves. Each addresses a different niche: cell therapy for a viral-driven cancer (*Atara’s Tab-cel*), a genetic disease cure with a bonus voucher (*Fortress/Sentynl’s Menkes drug*), and a novel drug-device for a common condition (*Aquestive’s epinephrine film*). These are classic asymmetric bets – downside is limited to our stake (which we’ve sized modestly and can stop out), but upside on success could be multiples, as the market often dramatically reprices companies that transition from development to commercialization. Importantly, these three are uncorrelated: an FDA setback in one has no read-through to the others (different diseases and product types). We’ve essentially created our own mini “event-driven biotech fund” within the portfolio. The next two weeks (Week 16-17) are crucial: by mid-January we’ll know the outcomes for ATRA and FBIO, and by end of January AQST. Our plan is to **harvest gains** if theses play out (we won’t fall in love with any single stock – the goal is to capitalize on the event pop, then rotate). Conversely, if any fail, we’ll cut losses swiftly (our strict stops ensure we live to fight another day). This sleeve is what’s driving our outsized alpha (as evidenced by our high Sharpe/Sortino so far). It’s high risk, but we’ve managed that risk through position sizing and diversification.

* **Clean Tech / Climate Sleeve (HDSN, AMTX):** These two holdings represent *fundamental, longer-term plays* benefiting from macro trends (regulatory tailwinds for emissions reduction) and company-specific execution. **Hudson Technologies** provides steady earnings and has shareholder-friendly capital allocation (buybacks) – a rarity in micro-caps. It anchors the portfolio with a relatively lower volatility profile and real profits. We expect continued strength as the world transitions to newer refrigerants – HDSN’s reclamation business for legacy refrigerants is both profitable and environmentally critical[\[38\]](https://www.rttnews.com/3599883/hudson-technologies-increases-share-repurchase-authorization-to-20-mln.aspx#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20board%20of%20directors,stock%20in%20calendar%20year%202026). **Aemetis** is our more aggressive bet here: it’s currently unprofitable, but we believe 2026 is the inflection to positive cash flow[\[25\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nasdaq-amtx/aemetis/news/aemetis-incs-nasdaqamtx-shift-from-loss-to-profit-2/amp#:~:text=Aemetis%2C%20Inc,is%20expected%20to%20breakeven). The company is effectively using government incentives (tax credits, grants) to bankroll improvements that could *10x* EBITDA by 2027\. This week’s jump after selling tax credits proves Aemetis can *monetize* the Inflation Reduction Act benefits in the near term[\[6\]](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/aemetis-receives-17-million-from-sale-of-federal-clean-energy-tax-credits-93CH-4425308#:~:text=CUPERTINO%2C%20Calif.%20,date%20according%20to%20InvestingPro%20data)[\[27\]](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/aemetis-receives-17-million-from-sale-of-federal-clean-energy-tax-credits-93CH-4425308#:~:text=After%20transaction%20costs%2C%20the%20company,proceeds%20of%20approximately%20%2415%20million). These two stocks hedge our biotech binary risk to an extent – they’re tied to tangible assets and cash flows. Even if biotech hits bumps, HDSN/AMTX can help preserve capital. Both have catalysts too, albeit of a different nature: HDSN could rerate on continued earnings beats or a strategic move (e.g., an acquisition or expanded buyback), and AMTX will steadily re-rate if quarterly results show narrowing losses. We’ll need some patience here, but time is on our side with these, as downside is cushioned (HDSN by earnings, AMTX by asset value and government support).

* **Portfolio Outlook:** Our portfolio’s **current value \~$390** is well above the \~$322 had we just tracked the S\&P 500【user context】 – a testament to this strategy of concentrated micro-cap bets. With many catalysts converging in January, volatility will spike, but that’s part of the design. We are entering a period of potential rapid portfolio value changes. By the end of January, we might be sitting on significantly higher equity (if even 1-2 of the biotech events hit), or we could give back some gains (if events disappoint). We’ve accepted this distribution of outcomes and crafted an approach to maximize the upside while limiting the downside: *don’t over-bet any single event, do rigorous research (as seen with our sources) to tilt odds in our favor, and cut losses without hesitation.* Our **Sharpe ratio \~3.24 (annualized)**【user context】 indicates excellent risk-adjusted performance so far; the coming weeks will test our ability to maintain it. We plan to keep that Sharpe high by quickly eliminating losers (protecting the downside) and letting winners run a bit. The **max drawdown to date is \~20.8%**【user context】 (from early in the experiment) – we aim to keep any future drawdowns around or below that level. Using stop losses and having some cash buffer are key tools for this.

* **Next Steps:** After the January catalyst storm, we anticipate rotating the portfolio again. If ATRA and/or FBIO are big winners, we may cash out and have substantial capital to redeploy. We already have a pipeline of ideas (other biotech events later in Q1, or perhaps shifting to a different sector like small-cap tech if the right setup emerges). Each week, we’ll re-evaluate: *Does each holding still have a clear reason to be held?* If not, it gets replaced. This disciplined, dynamic approach will continue. We won’t hesitate to go back to a higher cash position if we can’t find good setups – preservation of capital is as important as growth. By staying research-focused and nimble, we’re confident we can extend our outperformance through the remainder of the experiment.

In summary, we enter Week 16 with a **focused portfolio of five stocks**: three biotech catalyst plays that could each deliver a major win, and two clean-tech plays providing both stability and growth potential from secular trends. Every position has a defined thesis and exit strategy (stops or profit-taking levels) – nothing is left to chance. The portfolio is aligned with our mandate of seeking outsized alpha from micro-caps while enforcing risk controls. The coming weeks will likely be eventful; our preparation and rules should enable us to react swiftly and rationally. We’ve set the stage for potential **significant portfolio appreciation** if things go our way, while measures are in place to prevent a thesis failure from derailing our overall performance. This balanced aggression is how we plan to continue outperforming the S\&P 500 by a wide margin, as we have so far.
