### Thesis review for each holding

**HDSN — Thesis intact, with overhang.** The original thesis rests on HFC phasedown tailwinds (AIM Act), refrigerant reclamation growth, and DLA contract value. The DLA bid protest (Jan 30) creates genuine uncertainty, but Hudson has been the DLA prime contractor since 2016 and management expressed confidence in ultimate resolution. The new CEO Kenneth Gaglione (appointed Nov 24) brings operational continuity. Q3 beat showed the core business is performing ($74M revenue, +20% YoY). The $20M buyback program, $89.7M cash with zero debt, and CARB REFRESH positioning all support the hold. **Forward thesis: Hold through Q4 earnings (Mar 11) for potential re-rating if DLA clarity emerges.** Analyst targets ($9–10) offer 21–35% upside. Risk: if DLA permanently awards to a competitor, stock could retest $5–6 range.

**VNDA — Thesis at inflection point.** This position was predicated on the Bysanti PDUFA as the primary catalyst. The 505(b)(2) pathway, clean FDA review signal ("no potential review issues identified"), and bioequivalence to already-approved iloperidone support a **65–80% estimated approval probability**. NEREUS approval (Dec 30, 2025) validated Vanda's pipeline execution and provides a revenue floor. The imsidolimab BLA submission (Dec 15) for generalized pustular psoriasis adds a mid-2026 catalyst. Tradipitant for GLP-1-induced nausea (positive Phase 2 data: 50% vomiting reduction) is a potentially large long-term opportunity. **The key strategic question: is the risk/reward of holding through a binary event justified at −5.1% unrealized?** At current levels, a Bysanti approval could drive the stock to $9–14 (analyst range), while rejection could send it to $5–6. The asymmetry favors holding, especially given the multi-catalyst pipeline. Feb 11 earnings will provide the final data point before making a definitive hold-or-trim decision.

**RCKT — High-risk, high-reward binary position.** The thesis is simple: Kresladi approval on March 28 would be transformative. The clinical data (100% OS, all endpoints met, no treatment-related SAEs in a fatal pediatric disease with no gene therapy alternative) is among the cleanest in gene therapy. The prior CRL was CMC-only, a more addressable concern than clinical failure. FDA acceptance of the BLA resubmission itself is a positive signal. **The risk is a third CMC-related rejection**, which would likely send the stock below $2.00 and raise existential questions about the manufacturing platform. At ~$45 position value, the total capital at risk is modest. The widened $2.40 stop provides 20% downside protection while preserving PDUFA optionality. The Rare Pediatric Disease PRV ($100–150M) would be immediately value-accretive upon approval. **Forward thesis: This is a lottery-type position where the math favors holding — even at 60% approval probability, the expected value of $5–10 approval price vs. $1.50–2.00 CRL price is positive.**

**PESI — Early-stage position with validating thesis.** Entry at $15.47 captured the stock post-Richland permit expansion (Jan 9) but pre-Hanford DFLAW revenue ramp. The investment thesis centers on an **inflection from unprofitable environmental services company to recurring-revenue beneficiary of multi-decade nuclear waste cleanup**. Management projects $1–2M monthly Hanford revenue starting early 2026, with $200M+ in contract pipeline decisions expected this year. All five tracked insiders bought stock in 2025 at $7–9, and are sitting on 70–110% gains — strong alignment. The 0.38 beta makes PESI a genuine portfolio stabilizer amid biotech volatility. **Forward thesis: Hold through Q4 earnings (Mar 19) for evidence of revenue inflection. The $20 Craig-Hallum target offers 31% upside.** Primary risk: DOGE-driven federal spending cuts to DOE cleanup budgets.
