THESIS REVIEW SUMMARY

### Portfolio Strategy: Concentrated Catalyst Capture

**Week 19 positioning rationale:** The portfolio expands from two positions to four, creating a concentrated catalyst portfolio with three binary events in Q1 2026 (KOD GLOW2, VNDA Bysanti PDUFA, RCKT Kresladi PDUFA) anchored by a stable clean-tech compounder (HDSN). The 64.5% biotech weighting reflects high conviction in upcoming catalysts with asymmetric risk/reward profiles.

### Individual Position Theses

**HDSN (Clean Tech Anchor — 19.7%):** Thesis remains "quiet compounder with regulatory tailwinds." December 2025 developments (CARB REFRESH selection, Refrigerants Inc. acquisition, doubled buyback to $40M) strengthen the case despite CEO transition. Key risk is HFC price cyclicality, but $89.7M cash with zero debt provides cushion. Q4 earnings March 10-11 will be first report under new CEO Kenneth Gaglione — execution visibility is the primary watchpoint.

**KOD (Biotech Catalyst — 15.6%):** Exception granted for market cap breach. HIGH conviction based on GLOW2 trial differentiation from prior DME failures — diabetic retinopathy has different disease biology and endpoints. GLOW1 durability signal (41.1% vs 1.4% sham with 6-month dosing) is compelling. December offering at $23/share (above our $26.70 entry) and Point72's 5.5% stake provide institutional validation. Position size ($52) appropriately captures binary upside while limiting downside to ~$3 at stop.

**VNDA (New Core Biotech — 31.9%):** Highest conviction new addition. Unlike typical binary biotech plays, Vanda has commercial revenue ($210-230M FY25), three marketed drugs (Fanapt, HETLIOZ, PONVORY), and $293M cash. The Feb 21 Bysanti PDUFA is additive optionality, not existential risk — even a CRL leaves fundamental value intact. Nereus launch (first new motion sickness drug in 40 years) ongoing. Imsidolimab BLA filed December 2025 provides mid-2026 catalyst. Analyst consensus $13.63 implies 66% upside.

**RCKT (Speculative Catalyst — 17.0%):** Classic binary bet on March 28 PDUFA. Prior BLA rejection was explicitly manufacturing-related with no safety or efficacy concerns raised — a more favorable setup than de novo review. Kresladi showed 100% patient survival at 12 months in LAD-I trial. Priority Review Voucher (~$150M value) provides meaningful upside optionality. Position sized to limit damage if rejected while capturing substantial gains if approved.

### Risk Budget Assessment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Max drawdown if all stops hit | ~$50 (HDSN $12 + KOD $3 + VNDA $22 + RCKT $13) = -15% from equity |
| Probability of simultaneous stops | <5% — Positions are uncorrelated |
| Expected 4-week portfolio range | $280 - $420 depending on catalyst outcomes |
| Best case scenario | KOD + VNDA + RCKT all positive = potential 40-60% portfolio gain |
| Worst case scenario | All three binary events negative = ~25-30% drawdown (stops limit further damage) |

### Next Week Priorities
1. Confirm VNDA and RCKT order fills Monday January 27
2. Monitor KOD for GLOW2 topline data announcement (last patient visits completing)
3. Track HDSN price action; review for any pre-earnings positioning
4. Maintain PESI/FCEL on watchlist as backup candidates if cash increases
