## Thesis Review Summary (Week 11)
Our portfolio is now a balanced collection of six high-conviction plays and one moderate diversifier, each with specific catalysts or fundamental drivers:
- Eton Pharmaceuticals (ETON) – Thesis: A rare-disease specialty pharma generating real revenue and nearing a key FDA approval. Eton’s diversified orphan drug portfolio (Alkindi, Carglumic Acid, etc.) underpins a growing revenue stream (Q3 sales +129% YoY)[1], providing downside support uncommon in small caps. The upcoming FDA decision on ET-600 in Feb 2026 is a catalyst that could significantly boost earnings (first mover in pediatric diabetes insipidus)[12]. We see ETON as a growth-at-reasonable-risk play: it’s profitable on an adjusted basis, has a clear catalyst path, and trades at a modest ~4x annualized sales – attractive if ET-600 and other pipeline moves hit. Our stance: High conviction hold. It anchors the portfolio’s lower-risk end. We expect continued stock appreciation into the PDUFA. We maintain our stop to protect against any surprise (e.g., FDA delay or a missed quarter), but otherwise ride the trend.
- PepGen (PEPG) – Thesis: A cutting-edge biotech on the cusp of validating a treatment for a major untapped disease (DM1). PepGen’s peptide-oligonucleotide platform achieved a record 53.7% splice correction in DM1 patients[4] – a result that sent shockwaves in that research community (and the stock +120%). This strongly de-risks their approach; if they can replicate this in multiple doses and show clinical benefit (muscle function gains), PepGen could become a takeover target or a multi-bagger on its own. They smartly fortified their balance sheet (runway into 2027), so the usual cash crunch risk is low[19]. We acknowledge it’s early (Phase 1/2), but in biotech, platform quality is king, and PepGen’s looks validated by data and dollars (institutional investors piled into the offering). Our stance: Bullish, with the position size moderated after profit-taking. We’re essentially “house money” now (remaining position largely gains). We’ll eagerly await the Q1 2026 dose data – any positive incremental news (safety at 15mg repeated, some functional hints) could propel PEPG higher. Downside seems limited to maybe the $4-$5 range (our stop at $5.20 is above break-even), given the cash per share and platform value.
- Atara Biotherapeutics (ATRA) – Thesis: A classic binary event special situation. Atara has spent years (and hundreds of millions) developing Tab-cel for a tiny population – but one with essentially no treatments. After an EU approval and an FDA setback (manufacturing issues), it’s back at the finish line. Our view is that the risk of another CRL is relatively low: the FDA did not require new trials, just CMC fixes, which presumably are done. Also, handing over the BLA to Pierre Fabre signals that the regulatory work is solid[23]. If approved, Atara instantly goes from a development-stage to a commercial-stage (with partner) company and should receive a $40M cash infusion (nearly half its market cap!). Moreover, it would hold a priority review voucher (PRV) due to Tab-cel’s rare pediatric designation – that PRV itself could be sold for ~$100M. These aspects aren’t fully appreciated by the market. However, we temper our enthusiasm: Atara’s pipeline beyond Tab-cel is limited (they paused other programs). So the longer-term story might be either an acquisition by Pierre Fabre or Atara winding down after monetizing Tab-cel. Our stance: We’re optimistic for approval and a resulting stock pop (possibly to the mid-$20s, given PRV + milestone value). We’ll likely monetize on success, because beyond that initial bump the growth might stall (the PTLD market is very small, and Atara might need to raise funds to pursue new uses). If it fails, downside is severe (sub-$5); we’d take our lumps and exit as the thesis (regulatory turnaround) would be busted. Our small position size reflects this risk.
- Cardiol Therapeutics (CRDL) – Thesis: An early clinical bet that paid off with intriguing data, now pivoting to a longer-term development story. Cardiol’s vision is to use pharmaceutically-produced cannabidiol to treat inflammatory heart diseases – an unconventional idea met with skepticism initially. The ARCHER trial results, while just missing significance on the primary endpoint, showed enough positive signals (reduced heart inflammation on MRI)[3] to suggest the drug is active in acute myocarditis. This is crucial: myocarditis has no approved therapies and often requires heart transplant or can be fatal. By demonstrating any objective improvement, Cardiol positioned itself as a leader in this niche. The data need to be reproduced in a larger trial, but the company now has momentum to either partner or raise funds at hopefully better valuations. With a market cap under $100M, Cardiol is trading at optionality value; if it eventually succeeds, that could be a multi-billion dollar market (treating various inflammatory cardiac conditions). Our stance: We originally bought for the data catalyst and trimmed some profit. We’re inclined to keep a toe-hold for the long run, given the compelling science and the relative undervaluation (their closest comp, a company developing myocarditis therapy, would likely command much more). We will, however, be cautious regarding their cash needs – likely in 2025 they’ll need financing for Phase III. So we may treat this as a swing trade, taking more profits if the stock rallies on Monday’s data details, then potentially re-enter on dips. In sum, Cardiol remains a speculative but potentially rewarding part of our biotech basket.
- Sigma Lithium (SGML) – Thesis: A strategic materials play with both fundamental and speculative appeal. Fundamentally, Sigma is ramping up production of battery-grade lithium, benefiting from rising EV demand. They’ve proven they can operate the mine effectively (recoveries >70%, production costs trending down). In Q3 they generated $28M revenue and are on track to double production in the next couple of years with Phase 2[46][47]. So on earnings potential alone (if lithium prices rebound, Sigma could have, say, $200M+ EBITDA in a strong year), the stock is arguably cheap relative to global lithium peers. The speculative angle: Sigma has been rumored as a takeover target (even Tesla was speculated at one point) and there’s active talk of partnerships – our research confirmed investor optimism around an upcoming partnership announcement[48]. Additionally, Sigma’s high ESG credentials (“Zero tailings, zero carbon”) make it attractive for institutional investors who need green assets[49]. Our stance: We added SGML as a diversifier, and that remains valid – it’s not correlated with biotech events, yet has its own catalyst path. We trimmed a little due to its size in our portfolio and to stay true to sub-$500M focus, but we retain conviction that something good (either an offtake deal or the next earnings showing positive cash flow) will happen in the next few months. We’re prepared for volatility (lithium stocks are swingy), hence the stop at $9.20 to limit downside. But if the stock works (e.g., partnership materializes), we could see a quick move to mid-teens or higher, at which point we’d re-evaluate valuation vs. remaining upside.
- Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST) – Thesis: A binary FDA approval trade with favorable setup. Milestone’s etripamil nasal spray addresses a clear need: allowing patients with PSVT to treat themselves wherever they are, instead of rushing to an ER for an IV drug. The clinical data is robust (primary endpoint met, safety good)[8]. The only reason it’s not approved already is a couple of manufacturing questions – which the company has resolved in its resubmission. We did thorough due diligence confirming the FDA’s concerns were indeed CMC and that no new efficacy issues came up[32]. With that in mind, we assign a high probability of approval on Dec 13. What’s striking is how well-prepared Milestone is for commercialization: they’ve raised cash, ramped spending on launch prep, and even finalized a Phase 3 protocol to expand usage in Afib patients (which suggests they’re confident in approval)[34][50]. Typically, a small-cap with an impending approval trades higher than 1x cash – but MIST’s EV is maybe ~$100M, which seems low for a near-approved cardio drug that could target tens of thousands of patients. Our stance: We’re initiating this position because the risk/reward is skewed: if approved, a move to $5+ (double current) is very feasible given comparables (other small biotechs that got drugs approved often jump to $300M-$500M valuations). If not approved (another CRL), downside might see the stock around cash value ($2 or slightly below) because investors know the issues are likely fixable (though it would delay things by ~6-12 months). We sized our buy such that a worst-case isn’t portfolio-crippling. We will watch this like a hawk into Dec 13 and have a stop to manage any pre-event rumor sell-offs. But overall, this is exactly the kind of defined catalyst, event-driven position we want to have.

Collectively, our portfolio embodies a “barbell strategy”: on one end, ETON and SGML provide fundamental support (revenues or hard assets), and on the other, we have several high-octane biotech catalysts (MIST, ATRA, PEPG, CRDL) that could deliver outsized returns independent of the market. Our performance so far is strong (Sharpe ~1.72 for the period, well above market[51]) thanks to successful catalyst plays (e.g., PEPG doubling, timely exits like OTLK before earnings). We aim to continue this momentum by hitting on one or two of these upcoming binary events while our “steady” names hold value.

We acknowledge the portfolio’s beta (2.4 vs S&P[52]) indicates high volatility – not surprising given concentration in small biotechs. However, the low R² (0.05) suggests our returns are mostly idiosyncratic alpha – exactly what we want in a stock-picking experiment. We will keep managing risk via stops and prudent sizing. Going into Week 11 and beyond, we feel the portfolio is well-positioned: we have multiple shots on goal (at least four significant events in the next six weeks) and enough diversity that a single failure won’t derail us. We will, as always, adjust if the facts change, but currently each holding’s thesis remains intact or strengthened.
