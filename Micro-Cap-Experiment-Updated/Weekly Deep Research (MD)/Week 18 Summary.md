# Week 18 Portfolio Thesis Review

As we enter Week 18, our portfolio's core thesis remains "balanced aggression" – pairing bold, event-driven bets with steady compounders to maximize upside while controlling risk. Here's a concise review of each sleeve and what the next week(s) mean for them:

## Biotech Catalyst Sleeve

This is our engine for outsized gains. Currently, it consists of RGNX and the newly added KOD. Both have binary catalysts on the near-term horizon: RGNX awaits FDA approval of RGX-121 for Hunter syndrome by Feb 8, and KOD expects Phase 3 results in diabetic eye disease in Q1. 

These two plays are scientifically and clinically independent – success or failure in one has no read-through to the other, which is by design to spread risk. We have sized each such that a negative outcome won't crush our portfolio (we estimate a single failure would cost us a few percent to at most ~10% of portfolio, which we can recover), but a positive outcome could add a double-digit percentage gain. This asymmetry is the heart of our strategy.

### Recent Validation

In the past week, we saw this approach validated: Fortress Biotech (FBIO), a prior catalyst holding, won FDA approval for its rare disease drug (Menkes) – we captured a modest profit and exited on the news, avoiding the subsequent pullback (the stock oddly sold off despite approval, underscoring why pre-planned exits are wise). Conversely, another former holding, AQST, had a negative turn and we cut it immediately. These actions kept our biotech sleeve nimble and safeguarded capital.

### Week 18 Positioning

Looking ahead, Week 18 is about positioning for the next wave: Fortress's catalyst is behind us, and we now rotate that allocation into Kodiak Sciences, which has perhaps the most mispriced upcoming catalyst we could find (the stock trades at a fraction of its former value, implying skepticism that we think might be proven wrong). 

By mid-February, we will know the outcomes of RGNX and KOD. Our plan, as previously stated, is to "harvest and rotate" – take profits swiftly if either pops (these small-cap biotechs can give back gains if one hesitates) and cut losses without mercy if outcomes disappoint. The lesson from last week's FBIO and AQST trades is fresh: predefine your exit and stick to it. We've done so.

### Summary

In summary, the biotech sleeve is poised for a potentially pivotal few weeks: it could propel our portfolio to new highs if things go well, or knock us back slightly if not – but in either case, we're prepared to react and move on to the subsequent opportunities (we have a pipeline of next catalysts like ALDX, etc., to redeploy into). This sleeve remains the primary alpha generator of the portfolio, and we approach it with confident but disciplined optimism.

## Clean Tech / Value Sleeve

HDSN and AMTX form the ballast of our portfolio. They may not grab headlines like FDA approvals, but their role is crucial: they provide stability and participate in secular growth themes that can independently create value.

### Hudson Technologies (HDSN) - The Quiet Compounder

Hudson Technologies is our "quiet compounder." Its business of refrigerant reclamation is steadily profitable and benefits from environmental regulations phasing out harmful refrigerants – a trend that ensures demand for Hudson's services. 

We saw evidence of Hudson's financial strength and shareholder-friendliness in its recent actions: it's acquiring complementary businesses to expand its footprint, and it's doubling its share buyback program. These moves give us confidence that even if the market wobbles, HDSN has an inherent value floor (strong earnings, low PE, and now an active buyback to support the stock). 

Since inception of the experiment, HDSN has indeed been a low-volatility anchor, and we expect it to continue in that role – "slow and steady wins the race" fits here. We'll keep an eye on its Q4 earnings (due in a few weeks) for any major surprises, but otherwise, we're content to let this one grind upward.

### Aemetis (AMTX) - Dynamic Value Play

Aemetis is a more dynamic value play. It's small and previously struggling, but on the cusp of a potential transformation from perennial losses to break-even or better, thanks to operational improvements and government incentives. 

Last week validated our thesis that policy catalysts can unlock value: the stock jumped when Aemetis announced it received $17M from the federal tax credit program (a welcome cash infusion) – a sign that its projects are starting to yield financial results. We anticipate more such milestones: possibly announcements of new renewable natural gas (RNG) production coming online (they aim to reach 500,000 MMBtu by end of 2025 and 1M by 2026) and updates on their ethanol business efficiency gains. 

AMTX's stock is still very cheap relative to its 2026 potential (which management claims could be EBITDA-positive and on a growth trajectory), so we see significant upside if the company executes. However, we remain measured – it's still a small cap with execution risk, hence our moderate position size and firm stop to cap downside.

### Sleeve Performance

Together, HDSN and AMTX counterbalance the binary nature of our biotechs: they are tied to macro trends (decarbonization, infrastructure spending) rather than binary events. Notably, their performance has low correlation to biotech catalysts – for instance, when FBIO's news didn't move the needle for the market, AMTX was rallying on its own news, and HDSN barely blinked. This is exactly what we want from this sleeve: uncorrelated returns to smooth the ride. 

So far, this strategy is working – our Sharpe and Sortino ratios are strong, indicating good risk-adjusted performance. Going into Week 18, our plan for this sleeve is "monitor and hold." We don't anticipate major fireworks from HDSN/AMTX in the immediate week, but they're positioned to either hold value if biotech falters, or add incremental gains if any sector rotation favors value stocks (there are early signs of a small-cap value rotation in 2026, which could benefit names like these).

## Overall Portfolio Outlook

We have navigated the first half of this 26-week experiment successfully, turning an initial ~$318 into ~$339, outperforming the S&P (which would be ~$326). The next few weeks are where we aim to press our advantage. 

### Risk Management

The decisions this week – cutting losers, taking profits, and redeploying into fresh opportunities – exemplify our active management. Our max drawdown to date is ~-20.8%, incurred in late September when markets were weak; since then, our downside has been much more contained, thanks to stop-loss discipline. We are determined to keep any drawdowns from here limited – which is why every new position (KOD included) has a predefined exit to prevent a tailspin.

### Volatility Management

The portfolio's beta > 2 means we fully expect volatility, especially as these biotech events play out. But as we've emphasized, volatility in pursuit of upside is acceptable as long as we manage the downside. This philosophy will continue to guide us.

### Scenarios

By mid-February, if all goes well, we could see a substantial step-up in portfolio value (a successful RGNX approval alone might push us past the $400 mark – for perspective, RGNX could trade significantly higher on approval given its pipeline royalty streams, and we have a decent chunk invested). If things go poorly, our protection kicks in, and we might give back some gains – but even in a scenario where both current biotech bets fail, the portfolio would likely still be around flat to slightly up vs inception, courtesy of the gains banked from earlier wins. That resiliency is key.

## Summary

Our thesis is unchanged: maintain a concentrated but hedged portfolio. We take bold positions on high-conviction, idiosyncratic catalysts (this week swapping one catalyst name for another to keep the momentum) and anchor them with solid, value-driven plays that march to their own drumbeat (secular climate themes, improving fundamentals). 

Every holding in the portfolio has a clear reason to be there and a defined trigger for exit (either a catalyst resolution or a stop-loss level). We've demonstrated our willingness to act decisively – e.g., cutting AQST immediately when its thesis broke, and trimming winners when targets hit. We will continue this unemotional, thesis-driven approach.

As we step into Week 18, the portfolio is poised for what could be a very eventful period. We've done our homework on each name and outlined contingency plans. Now it's about execution and monitoring. If our theses play out, we should capture substantial upside; if not, we'll mitigate the damage swiftly. 

**This balanced aggression – swinging for alpha while fielding a strong defense – has served us well so far, and we'll stick with it.** We remain confident that by staying research-driven and disciplined, our portfolio will continue to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis, regardless of what the broader market throws at us in the coming weeks.
