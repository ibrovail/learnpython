# Updated Thesis Review Summary (for next week's evaluation)

As we enter Week 19, our portfolio thesis has tightened into a more defensive version of "balanced aggression": we are still pursuing asymmetric upside via two independent biotech catalysts (RGNX, KOD), but we are now materially more cash-heavy after a rules-driven stop-out in AMTX. This shift reduces drawdown risk and gives us flexibility to redeploy only when setups improve.

## Biotech Catalyst Sleeve (RGNX, KOD)

This remains our primary alpha engine, now carrying most of the portfolio's intentional risk.

### RGNX (RGX-121, Hunter syndrome) – FDA decision Feb 8, 2026

RGNX remains our highest-conviction event trade. Price action improved on Jan 20 (+3.5%) despite a broad risk-off tape, suggesting the market is still actively positioning into the decision window. We intentionally kept the position size modest (currently 3 shares) to respect pre-PDUFA volatility while preserving meaningful upside if approval lands. The stop at $12.50 remains the hard risk cap; we do not "widen stops" into catalysts.

### KOD (tarcocimab, diabetic retinopathy) – GLOW2 topline in Q1 2026

KOD is our second, uncorrelated catalyst. It is positioned as a mispricing opportunity: sentiment remains sceptical post-history, which can produce a strong re-rate if data is clean. We initiated a starter position (2 shares @ $26.70). The stop at $22.00 keeps downside bounded while allowing for normal volatility ahead of results.

**Sleeve intent:** Two independent catalyst bets means we do not rely on any single outcome for alpha. The plan remains "harvest and rotate": take profits swiftly on success (biotech pops fade), and cut decisively on failure.

## Clean Tech / Value Sleeve (HDSN only; AMTX removed)

This sleeve has shifted from "two anchors" to one anchor + cash buffer, which is still acceptable given our mandate.

### AMTX exited via stop-loss (automatic) at $1.44 on Jan 20

The AMTX thesis was "turnaround + incentive monetisation", but the price invalidated our near-term execution tolerance, and the hard stop did its job. Importantly, this was not an emotional decision — it was a system-level risk control executing as designed. The outcome is constructive: we removed a weakening position before it could become another AQST-style drawdown event.

### HDSN remains our steady ballast

HDSN continues to serve as the portfolio's stabiliser. Even with a down day on Jan 20 (in-line with a broad selloff), its role is unchanged: profitable, shareholder-friendly, and less binary than the biotech sleeve. Stop remains $5.90.

**Sleeve intent:** HDSN dampens volatility, while the large cash position now provides the second stabilising leg previously provided by AMTX.

## Cash & Portfolio Posture (key change this week)

The major structural development this week is that we are now cash-rich (~$175, >50% of equity) following the AMTX stop-out. This changes our operating mode:

- We can avoid forcing trades in weak tapes.
- We can scale into conviction only when price improves (e.g., add to RGNX/KOD on favourable entries) while keeping liquidity for surprises.
- Cash also protects our max drawdown discipline, particularly with two catalyst names still pending.

## Overall Portfolio Outlook (Week 19 focus)

We are now positioned for a two-path outcome:

### Catalysts hit (RGNX and/or KOD succeed)

Portfolio can re-accelerate quickly; we will sell into strength and recycle into the next catalyst set.

### Catalysts miss / volatility spikes

Losses are capped via hard stops + modest sizing, and the large cash buffer limits portfolio damage, preserving the ability to re-enter new alpha opportunities.

## Summary

This week reinforced the most important part of the strategy: **risk control is non-negotiable**. AMTX exiting via stop is not a failure; it is the system protecting capital. The portfolio is now a clean, high-optionality structure: one steady anchor (HDSN), two independent catalysts (RGNX, KOD), and a significant cash war chest to deploy only when the odds and tape justify it.
