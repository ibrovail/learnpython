## **Thesis Review Summary**

* **ETON:** Rare-disease orphan-drug developer. Sale reflects poor share performance and limited near-term upside relative to risk. Removed from portfolio to preserve capital.  
* **CRDL:** Micro-cap cardio-therapeutic. Exited after modest gain; trial-readout binary and float thin; risk outweighs potential reward at current size.  
* **ATRA:** Allogeneic T-cell therapy; PDUFA Jan 2026 remains compelling. Small position preserved for asymmetric upside.  
* **SGML:** Lithium miner; maintains exposure to EV/commodity cycle, production expansion in early 2026 supports long-term thesis.  
* **MIST:** Nasal spray therapy for PSVT; holds until FDA decision 13 Dec. Pending outcome, value may re-rate or collapse — keep minimal exposure.  
* **HDSN (new):** Environmental-services company benefitting from regulatory shifts. Entry offers industrial/ESG-sector diversification, medium conviction.  
* **FCEL (new):** Clean-energy fuel-cell company gaining traction via government-backed contracts and energy demand surges. Entry adds energy-sector exposure, potential mid-term growth.  
* **ANIX (new, small):** Early-stage oncology biotech. Speculative entry ahead of upcoming Phase 1 results — high risk, asymmetric potential.
