**Thesis Review Summary** (Week 13 Outlook)

Our portfolio is constructed around **high-conviction, catalyst-driven themes** with diversity across sectors:

**Biotech FDA Catalysts:** We have two biotech positions in pivotal FDA approval phases – *Atara Biotherapeutics (ATRA)* and *Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST)*. ATRA’s allogeneic T-cell therapy (Tab-cel) could be a groundbreaking approval in early 2026, offering huge upside (and we’re already \+29%)[\[59\]](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4848792-atara-biotherapeutics-stock-empty-pipeline-little-gas#:~:text=Atara%20Biotherapeutics%3A%20An%20Empty%20Pipeline,Financial%20Overview). MIST just achieved its transformational catalyst (first product approved[\[3\]](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/13/3204944/0/en/Milestone-Receives-FDA-Approval-of-CARDAMYST-etripamil-as-First-and-Only-Self-Administered-Nasal-Spray-for-Adults-with-Paroxysmal-Supraventricular-Tachycardia-PSVT.html#:~:text=MONTREAL%20and%20CHARLOTTE%2C%20N,to%20be%20available%20in%20retail)); our thesis that this would unlock value is beginning to play out. We’ve adjusted our exposure to bank gains yet still allow for more upside as MIST transitions to commercialization. We’ve also added *Anixa (ANIX)* in the biotech space – a moonshot on cancer immunotherapy with promising early data, aligning with our strategy of allocating a small portion to asymmetric biotech opportunities. These biotech holdings are uncorrelated with the broader market and with each other (different indications), providing us multiple independent shots at outsized returns.

**Clean Energy & Climate Tech:** Our positions in *FuelCell Energy (FCEL)* and *Hudson Technologies (HDSN)* capitalize on secular trends in clean energy and environmental regulation. FCEL gives us exposure to the hydrogen economy and decentralized power – it’s speculative, but government support (e.g., DOE contracts[\[16\]](https://www.fuelcellenergy.com/blog/danbury-manufacturer-gets-8-million-federal-contract-to-prove-nuclear-alternative-newstimes#:~:text=FuelCell%20Energy%20Receives%20Contract%20for,nation%27s%20aging%20fleet%20of)) and the global push for net-zero provide a favorable backdrop. We entered after confirming improved revenue and a substantial backlog, which supports our thesis that FCEL is moving from concept towards a viable business. HDSN is a more stable play: it’s profitable now, riding a multi-year regulatory wave as environmentally harmful refrigerants are phased out. Our thesis is that Hudson’s earnings and stock will continue to climb as supply of virgin refrigerants dwindles (due to the AIM Act), forcing reclamation demand up – Q3’s strong results and management commentary about “regulatory tailwinds”[\[60\]](https://www.ainvest.com/news/hudson-technologies-leadership-shift-strategic-catalyst-growth-sustainable-refrigerant-sector-2511/#:~:text=...%20www.ainvest.com%20%20,like%20the%20AIM%20Act) affirm this. We see HDSN as a value play with growth characteristics (low P/E, high growth), providing ballast to the portfolio amid our riskier biotech bets.

**EV/Commodity Macro Theme:** *Sigma Lithium (SGML)* remains a cornerstone of our portfolio, aligning with the EV battery materials super-cycle. Our thesis is that Sigma’s low-cost lithium production and aggressive expansion will lead to revenue and cash flow inflection just as lithium demand soars in 2026[\[61\]](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-sigma-lithium-stock-surged-26-week-and-could-soar-2026#:~:text=That%20means%20there%20could%20be,capacity%20significantly%20to%20766%2C000%20tonnes). Recent lithium price increases and Sigma’s doubling stock price over the last month have validated our belief that the market was underestimating this story[\[41\]](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-sigma-lithium-stock-surged-26-week-and-could-soar-2026#:~:text=Keep%20an%20eye%20on%20Sigma,Lithium%20stock). Even after trimming, SGML is our largest holding, reflecting our high conviction. We will continue to hold a sizable position as we head into early 2026, when Sigma’s Phase 2 capacity ramp is expected to come online, potentially doubling output[\[42\]](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sigma-lithium-hosted-2024-investor-day-detailing-a-low-capex-construction-plan-to-triple-capacity-to-125-000t-lce-by-end-2026-recognized-as-climate-pioneer-by-nasdaq-302261460.html#:~:text=SIGMA%20LITHIUM%20HOSTED%202024%20INVESTOR,capacity%20by%202026%2C%20cementing). We note the stock is no longer under $500M market cap (\~$1.2B now)[\[62\]](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-sigma-lithium-stock-surged-26-week-and-could-soar-2026#:~:text=Shares%20of%20Sigma%20Lithium%20,by%20S%26P%20Global%20Market%20Intelligence)[\[63\]](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-sigma-lithium-stock-surged-26-week-and-could-soar-2026#:~:text=stock%20was%20under%20pressure%20for,year%2C%20as%20of%20this%20writing), but that growth is the result of the thesis playing out. We’re comfortable holding this mid-cap because it still offers significant upside (the lithium market momentum appears strong going into 2026, per industry forecasts[\[43\]](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-sigma-lithium-stock-surged-26-week-and-could-soar-2026#:~:text=a%20recovery%20in%20global%20demand%2C,12)).

**Overall Portfolio Thesis:** We have built a **diversified small-cap portfolio** focused on unique, catalyst-rich opportunities rather than broad market factors. The core idea is that by carefully selecting and managing these positions – each with distinct drivers (FDA approvals, commodity cycles, regulatory changes, clean tech adoption) – we can continue to generate alpha uncorrelated to the S\&P 500\. Our performance so far (portfolio value $359.44 vs $321.13 if in S\&P[\[57\]](https://investors.milestonepharma.com/press-releases#:~:text=Press%20Releases%20,Through%202025%20MONTREAL%20and)) shows success in that approach. 

Moving forward, we will continue to apply disciplined research and risk management. Every position is backed by a clear thesis and multiple source confirmations, and we stand ready to cut any that violate our thesis or risk limits. The coming weeks (late December into January) are critical, with at least one major binary event (ATRA FDA decision) and several company updates. By the end of next week, we will particularly evaluate MIST’s post-approval trading range and FCEL’s earnings outcome to decide if adjustments are needed. We’ll also keep scanning the horizon for **new opportunities** (within our rules) – for example, other small-caps with January catalysts or mispriced assets – but we will only deploy capital if a compelling thesis with verified facts emerges. Our current mix of holdings positions us well for both continuation of the bull trend in small-caps and for idiosyncratic success independent of market direction.
