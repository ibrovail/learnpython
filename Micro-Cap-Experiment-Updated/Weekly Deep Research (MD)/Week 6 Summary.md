## Restated Rules
**Budget Discipline:** Use only the current portfolio equity (~$295.90) and cash (~$47.20). No unplanned new capital or leverage; track cash precisely.  
**Execution Limits:** Long-only trades in full shares. No shorting, options, margin, or derivatives.  
**Universe Constraints:** Focus on U.S.-listed common stocks, micro/small-cap under $500 M market cap. Exclude OTC/pink sheets, funds, SPACs, warrants, preferreds, ADRs, bankrupt or halted names, as well as defense or Israeli-affiliated companies.  
**Risk Controls:** Adhere to position size and stop-loss rules. Set or maintain stop-losses for all holdings to cap downside. Immediately flag any breach of risk limits (e.g. position >40% of portfolio or liquidity below thresholds).  
**Weekly Cadence & Discretion:** This is the deep-research week; we can add new positions, trim, or exit as needed. We have full discretion to optimize risk-adjusted returns while respecting all rules and safeguards.

## Research Scope
We reexamined each current holding for new developments and verified upcoming catalysts via company press releases and SEC filings. Liquidity metrics (price, volume, float, spreads) were checked using exchange data and financial sites. We scanned for new micro-cap opportunities with near-term catalysts (earnings, FDA decisions, trial data) using biotech catalyst calendars, press releases, and financial news. We cross-checked market caps on official sources to ensure compliance with the sub-$500 M requirement. For example, we identified Rezolute (RZLT) as an interesting biotech (Phase 3 data in December) but confirmed its market cap is ~$847 M  
[stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com)  
, above our limit – so we ruled it out despite strong insider buying. Instead, we focused on a U.S. small-cap in the media/tech space with a confirmed upcoming earnings catalyst. All key claims (earnings dates, insider trades, trial results, etc.) are supported with at least one reliable source (company IR releases, major newswire, SEC filings), often two for confirmation. No catalyst has been assumed without evidence.

## Candidate Set
After filtering dozens of micro-cap names, we identified one compelling new candidate that meets all criteria (U.S.-listed, <$500 M cap, clear catalyst, adequate liquidity). We also list others considered and why they were passed over:

- **CuriosityStream (CURI)** – Streaming media (factual content). Thesis: Rapid revenue growth (+53% YoY in Q2) and nearing profitability [investors.curiositystream.com](https://investors.curiositystream.com). Upcoming Q3 earnings on Nov 12 [investors.curiositystream.com](https://investors.curiositystream.com); last quarter surprised with a profit ($0.01 EPS vs est. ~$-0.35). Key catalyst: potential beat and guidance raise could re-rate the stock higher. Liquidity: Price ~$4.5, market cap ~$256 M [public.com](https://public.com), ~1.2 M avg vol – passes filters. Low debt, insider ownership ~30% [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) (founder is Discovery Channel’s ex-Chairman). Catalyst certainty: High.  

- **Rezolute (RZLT)** – Biotech (rare pediatric disease). Phase 3 data due Dec 2025; insiders bought ~$9 M stock (strong confidence) [waiker.ai](https://www.waiker.ai). But: market cap ~$847 M [stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com) exceeds limit; excluded. Will monitor as an indicator for biotech sentiment.  

- **Immuneering (IMRX)** – Biotech (oncology). Positive pancreatic cancer trial data (Phase 2a) spiked shares +42% in Sep [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com). Market cap ~$330 M [stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com) post-spike. Catalyst: Additional data updates in 2026; nothing immediate. Passed (catalyst further out; stock retraced much of its spike).  

- **MoonLake Immuno (MLTX)** – Biotech (immunology). Phase 3 results in HS (skin disease) expected Q4; high chance of success given Phase 2. However: Market cap ~$3.5 B [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com) – too large and already well-followed.  

No viable tech/industrial found: We screened small-cap tech for near earnings catalysts but found none with both strong fundamentals and upcoming events. We prefer to deploy cash into CURI’s clear catalyst rather than force an idea. If no new candidate met our strict criteria, we would hold cash, but CURI stands out as a worthy addition this week.  

*(In summary, CURI is the only new buy recommended now, as it combines a tangible short-term catalyst with solid fundamentals and fits our micro-cap mandate. Other ideas were either over the cap limit or lacked near-term triggers.)*

---

## Portfolio Actions
Exit MAMA: Rationale: No near-term catalyst and stock is near peak after earnings. Insider selling (CEO sold ~10% of stake) suggests limited upside ahead [marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com). We’ll lock in gains and free ~15% capital for higher-alpha plays.  

Keep APYX: Rationale: High-conviction catalyst play. Q3 results on Nov 6 will showcase initial AYON system sales [biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com). We expect strong demand given the recent commercial launch (KOL event on Oct 14). Valuation remains reasonable (~3× sales) for a 20%+ revenue growth medtech. Maintaining full position (≈33% of portfolio) into earnings, with stop-loss in place for protection.  

Keep ETON: Rationale: Thesis intact. Q3 earnings Nov 6 will update on new product launches (FDA-approved Khindivi) and pipeline progress [globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com). ETON’s eight rare-disease drugs generate growing revenue, and any positive pipeline news (e.g. ET-600 NDA status) could be a catalyst. The stock is flat since entry, suggesting market is in “wait-and-see” mode – risk/reward still favorable. Holding ~37% allocation.  

Initiate CURI (CuriosityStream): Rationale: Diversify into Consumer/Tech with momentum and an imminent catalyst. Q3 earnings (Nov 12) likely to confirm robust growth (Q2 rev +53% YoY [investors.curiositystream.com](https://investors.curiositystream.com)) and approach toward breakeven. The company’s subscriber and distribution expansions (deals with Prime Video, DirecTV [investors.curiositystream.com](https://investors.curiositystream.com)) position it for continued outperformance. After a Q2 surprise profit, analyst targets imply 40%+ upside [stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com). We’ll deploy ~30% of the portfolio here.  

Stops & Risk Adj.: We will set a new stop-loss for CURI (details below) and maintain existing stops on APYX/ETON. No single holding will exceed ~40% of portfolio post-trades, and overall exposure remains fully within our mandate (3 stocks, ~99% invested). Cash will be minimal (~$3) after these moves, reflecting high confidence in the selected catalysts. We remain ready to reallocate quickly next week if events don’t play out as expected.

## Exact Orders

### 1. Sell Order (Exit Position)
**Action:** Sell  
**Ticker:** MAMA (Mama’s Creations)  
**Shares:** 4 (all shares)  
**Order Type:** Limit (DAY)  
**Limit Price:** $10.90  
**Time in Force:** Day (execute on 2025-10-28)  
**Intended Execution:** 2025-10-28 (morning)  
**Stop-Loss:** N/A (closing position)  
**Special Instructions:** Sell at or above $10.90, do not accept significantly lower price.  
**Rationale:** Locking in ~39 % gain on remaining shares. Stock has risen on an earnings beat (Q2 EPS $0.03 beat) [marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com) and trades near 52-week high. With no new catalysts until next earnings (Dec) and insider selling pressure, we redeploy capital to higher-upside opportunities. This exit also eliminates a low-conviction position and raises cash without breaching our liquidity rules (4 shares < 0.002 % of MAMA’s daily volume [marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com)).

---

### 2. Buy Order (New Position)
**Action:** Buy  
**Ticker:** CURI (CuriosityStream Inc.)  
**Shares:** 19 shares  
**Order Type:** Limit (DAY)  
**Limit Price:** $4.60  
**Time in Force:** Day (2025-10-28)  
**Intended Execution Date:** 2025-10-28  
**Stop-Loss (Post-Buy):** $4.00 (GTC once filled) – ~13 % below current price, just under recent support, to allow volatility but protect against a sharp post-earnings drop.  
**Special Instructions:** Buy on open if price ≤ $4.60; avoid chasing above limit. Ensure bid-ask spread < $0.05 (tight for this liquid stock).  
**Rationale:** Initiating ~$87 position (~29 % of portfolio) in this high-growth streaming content provider ahead of its Q3 earnings (Nov 12) [investors.curiositystream.com](https://investors.curiositystream.com). Q2 revenue jumped 53 % YoY to $19 M [investors.curiositystream.com](https://investors.curiositystream.com) and the company turned a surprise profit. With new distribution deals (Amazon, DirecTV) in Q3 and an expanding subscriber base, we anticipate an earnings beat or bullish guidance. The stock is still a “penny” name (~$4.50) despite improving fundamentals, providing asymmetric upside if the market re-rates it. Our limit is set near recent trading levels (last close ~$4.56) to ensure execution without overpaying. Liquidity is ample (1.2 M avg vol, $5 M+ daily turnover), and this buy represents <0.2 % of 3-month average volume – well within limits. A stop at $4.00 limits downside to ~<$11 (3.7 % of portfolio) if our thesis is wrong.

*(No changes to APYX and ETON position sizes this week – we simply maintain existing holdings with their stops. See “Risk and Liquidity Checks” for confirmations.)*

## Risk And Liquidity Checks

Post-Trade Concentration: The portfolio will hold 3 stocks – approx. allocations: ETON ~38%, APYX ~32%, CURI ~29% (cash ~1%). This is a balanced spread given each is a high-conviction, catalyst-driven play. No single position exceeds 40%, satisfying our diversification mandate. Sector exposure is split across Healthcare (ETON, APYX ~70% combined) and Media/Tech (CURI ~29%), reducing single-sector risk versus last week’s all-healthcare tilt.

Liquidity & Trade Size: All orders are small relative to market volumes. Selling 4 MAMA (~$44) is trivial against 283k avg daily shares
marketbeat.com
. Buying ~19 CURI (<<0.1% of 1.2M avg vol) likewise has negligible market impact. The per-order liquidity ratios are effectively 0%. Bid-ask spreads are narrow: MAMA ~$0.03, CURI ~$0.02 at last close – we expect minimal slippage on these orders.

Stop-Loss Placements: Stops are calibrated to each stock’s volatility and technical support:
APYX $2.80: ~11% below current price, just under Q2/Q3 support (the pre-rally base around $2.90)
finance.yahoo.com
. This should endure normal earnings volatility but protect against a severe disappointment. Max risk ~$0.33/share (~$10 total, ~3.4% of port).
ETON $16.00: ~13% below market, set below early-Oct trading support. Given biotech volatility and binary FDA risk, a somewhat wider stop avoids a whipsaw on minor dips
jaguaranalytics.com
. Risk per share ~$2.5 (~$15 total, ~5% of port).
CURI $4.00: ~13% drawdown allowance. $4 is a round-number support; a drop below would likely indicate a thesis break (e.g., poor earnings). This caps potential loss to ~$0.56/share (~$10.6 total, ~3.6% of port).

Overall: If all stops hit (unlikely simultaneously given different catalysts), total portfolio drawdown would be ~11–12%, within acceptable bounds. We are effectively risking ~$36 to pursue substantial upside on each catalyst (e.g., APYX FDA clearance or blowout earnings, ETON pipeline news, CURI growth surprise). This positive asymmetry aligns with our mandate to generate alpha while limiting downside.

Cash After Trades: Expected cash will be near $3 (leftover from CURI purchase), ~1% of portfolio – essentially fully invested. This is intentional given the abundance of near-term opportunities. We retain a tiny cash buffer for any unforeseen fees or to top up positions on an opportunistic dip, but essentially the portfolio is “all-in” on our best ideas. This is a calculated stance given each position has an imminent catalyst and we have protective stops in place.

## Monitoring Plan

Catalyst Calendar (Next 1–2 Weeks): We have a concentrated schedule: On Nov 6 pre-market, APYX reports Q3 earnings
biospace.com
, and on Nov 6 after hours, ETON reports Q3
stocktitan.net
. We will monitor both conference calls live for any surprise (positive or negative). Key watch points: For APYX – early adoption metrics of AYON system and any raised FY guidance (or FDA 510(k) update on label expansion). For ETON – sales ramp of newly launched products (e.g. Khindivi hydrocortisone solution approved May
globenewswire.com
) and status of pipeline milestones (like ET-600 NDA filing progress or any upcoming FDA decision). Any material deviation from expectations could warrant intra-week action (e.g., trimming if an outcome is underwhelming or adding if thesis strengthens and price hasn’t caught up). We will keep stops active through the events to guard against sharp drops, but note that in a gap-down scenario, actual exit price could be below stop – a risk we accept given the upside potential. Price/Volume Alerts: We’ll set real-time alerts around APYX ~$3.50 (breakout above recent range) and ETON ~$20, which would indicate strong bullish reactions, as well as alerts if either falls ~5–7% pre-stop (to assess if news or just noise). For CURI, earnings is on Nov 12; leading up to it, any unusual price move (±10%) or news (e.g., subscriber metrics release) will be scrutinized. We’ll listen to the Nov 12 call for commentary on subscriber growth, ARPU, and profitability timeline. Given CURI’s catalyst is after APYX/ETON, we have staggered events – allowing focused attention on each. Macro and Sector Factors: We’ll watch the Russell 2000 and XBI (biotech ETF) movements, as our micro-caps can be sensitive to risk sentiment. Notably, biotech had a strong bounce (XBI +2.95% vs S&P +1.18% on Oct 27) suggesting risk-on appetite
marketbeat.com
. If a broad small-cap selloff resumes (due to Fed, etc.), we might tighten stops or trim exposure proactively. Conversely, if micro-caps rally further, we’ll ride winners but still honor stop discipline. Continuous Diligence: We plan mid-week check-ins for any company-specific updates: APYX’s FDA 510(k) submission status (submitted Oct 13 for AYON label expansion
stocktitan.net
) – an FDA clearance could drop anytime (~90-day cycle). ETON’s FDA-related news (though their big PDUFA passed in May with Khindivi’s approval
globenewswire.com
, any new NDA acceptance or partnership could be announced). We will also monitor insider trading filings – e.g., if ETON insiders buy more ahead of Nov 6, that’s a bullish signal; if APYX insiders sell before earnings, we might trim preemptively. Post-Catalyst Gameplan: After Nov 6, we will evaluate outcomes:
If APYX pops strongly on good earnings, we may let it run but consider scaling out 20–30% to lock some profit (depending on guidance). If results disappoint and it gaps down below support, our stop $2.80 should trigger to prevent deeper loss (~-14%). We would then reassess whether the long-term thesis (helium plasma tech adoption) remains intact or exit fully.
If ETON soars on earnings or pipeline news, we might trim (given it would likely become >45% of port if it jumps 20%+) to rebalance and reduce single-stock risk. If it drops on a minor earnings miss but thesis intact (e.g., just timing issues in sales), we could hold through volatility (stop $16 is our fail-safe for a serious breakdown).
CURI’s event is after the others; we’ll decide whether to hold through Nov 12 or take profits beforehand if the stock runs up into the print. Since expectations are still modest (the consensus EPS is -$0.02
zacks.com
 despite last quarter’s beat), we are inclined to hold into earnings unless it surges far above our entry (~>$6) preemptively.
Risk Mitigation: If any holding issues a negative surprise (FDA rejection, big earnings miss, etc.), we will not “hope and hold.” We will cut the position (at stop or manually) to preserve capital, then analyze if it’s worth re-entering at a lower price. Our downside on each name is capped by stops (~3–5% of portfolio each). This ensures no single disappointment can drop total equity by more than ~5–6%, while successes could significantly boost it (e.g., APYX or ETON have 20%+ upside potential on good news given recent trading ranges and analyst targets). In summary, we’ll actively manage the news flow around Nov 6 and Nov 12, ready to adjust positions intra-week if needed, while otherwise sticking to our plan. The trading calendar is front-loaded (exits/entries on Oct 28, then catalyst reactions Nov 6 and Nov 12). We will provide a mid-week update if any unexpected development arises, especially if risk limits are approached.

## Thesis Review Summary

Going into Week 7, our portfolio is concentrated in three high-upside micro-caps, each with near-term events that could drive outperformance:
Mama’s Creations (MAMA) – Removed: Last week we trimmed this winner; this week we exit fully. The stock served us well (up ~40% from initial buy), but with no fresh catalysts, a stretched valuation (P/E ~100
marketbeat.com
), and insider selling in recent weeks, it’s prudent to secure profits. This reflects our discipline of rotating capital from plateauing stories into new catalyst-rich ideas.
Apyx Medical (APYX) – High-Conviction Hold: The upcoming Nov 6 earnings report is a pivotal moment. We expect it to showcase accelerating revenue, fueled by the new AYON body contouring system (launched September) and continued strong Renuvion sales. Notably, Apyx guided for robust FY25 growth after Q2, and the stock has begun to rally (+10% on Oct 24) on anticipation
stockinvest.us
. We’ll watch for management commentary on AYON adoption; successful uptake could propel APYX higher. We maintain our ~30% allocation with confidence, hedged by a stop at $2.80 (just below key support).
Eton Pharmaceuticals (ETON) – Steady Hold: ETON remains our largest holding (~37%). Our thesis – that ETON’s growing rare-disease drug portfolio and pipeline catalysts are underappreciated – still stands. The Nov 6 earnings call will update on the recent FDA approval of Khindivi™ (hydrocortisone) in May
globenewswire.com
(revenues should start reflecting this) and any progress on NDA filings (e.g., ET-600 for diabetes insipidus). We’re also watching for hints of partnership deals, as ETON has a history of licensing products. With shares flat week-over-week, the risk/reward into earnings skews positive. We’ll reassess sizing after the call; if the stock jumps to reflect its improved fundamentals (analysts see $20+ as fair value given pipeline), we may trim a bit simply to keep balance.
CuriosityStream (CURI) – New Entrant: We introduced CURI to add a non-biotech growth driver. As a pure-play factual streaming service, CURI offers a unique mix of strong execution (53% sales growth
investors.curiositystream.com
, narrowing losses) and a clear catalyst (earnings Nov 12). This diversifier offsets some biotech event risk while still targeting alpha: if CURI beats estimates and perhaps guides toward full-year profitability, the stock (still 80% below its 2021 SPAC highs) could re-rate sharply upward. Importantly, CURI’s inclusion brings a consumer discretionary element into our portfolio, reducing correlation – its drivers (subscribers, streaming trends) differ from those of APYX/ETON. We’ll monitor subscriber metrics and any commentary on cash burn (currently well-funded with ~$100 M cash after an Aug secondary
investors.curiositystream.com
). Our stop at $4.00 limits downside if the streaming story falters.
Big Picture: Our strategy this week is to lean into catalysts with a nearly fully invested portfolio. The overall portfolio beta (~4.1 vs S&P, though with low R²)
x.com
 remains high, meaning volatility is expected – but that’s by design in pursuing outsized gains. We’ve managed idiosyncratic risk by ensuring each holding has independent drivers: a medtech earnings story, a specialty pharma pipeline, and a streaming media turnaround. This cross-sector mix should mitigate any single industry shock. We are exiting any laggards or low-conviction names (MAMA) and aggressively positioning in our best ideas, consistent with the mandate to seek alpha. Our stop-loss strategy is tightened appropriately now that many positions have moved up: for example, last week we raised MAMA’s stop to $10 (now moot with our exit) to protect profits
marketbeat.com
. We’ll continue this practice – as winners run, we will ratchet up stops to secure gains, as we did with MAMA and would do with APYX or ETON if they jump post-catalyst. Conversely, if a thesis is invalidated, we will cut losses swiftly. In summary, we believe the portfolio is well-positioned for the week ahead: we have a clear plan for each holding around its catalyst, defined exit levels to contain risk, and dry powder effectively deployed into a promising new play. Success for even one of our high-conviction catalysts could significantly boost the portfolio’s value, while our risk measures ensure that any downside is limited to a small fraction of capital. We will report back next week with results and will be ready to adjust course as needed depending on how these events unfold.

## Confirm Cash And Constraints

After executing the above orders, the portfolio’s cash balance will be approximately $3.00 (residual cash). This accounts for selling MAMA (~$43.60) and spending ~$87.40 on CURI, netted with the starting cash ~$47.20. We have not introduced any new cash beyond the current assets, in line with our hard budget rule. All trades comply with the stated constraints: full shares only, and all tickers are U.S.-listed, sub-$500 M market cap stocks (APYX ~$106 M
marketbeat.com
, ETON ~$480 M
jaguaranalytics.com
, CURI ~$256 M
public.com
). Liquidity is well within limits (each position <0.5% of daily volume), and no prohibited sectors (defense/Israeli) or instruments are involved. Stop-losses are now in effect on 100% of long positions. In conclusion, we have realigned the portfolio to maximize exposure to imminent catalysts while staying within all guidelines. We will remain vigilant through the week’s events and ready to take any necessary defensive action, but as of now, the portfolio is optimally configured to pursue superior risk-adjusted returns in the coming days.
