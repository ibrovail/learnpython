**Thesis Review Summary:**  
After this week’s adjustments, our portfolio remains aligned with a two-pronged strategy: **(1) Event-Driven Biotech** and **(2) Clean Tech/Value**. We have, however, narrowed the biotech sleeve from three names to two, reflecting the outcome of recent events. Here’s the updated thesis breakdown:

1. **Biotech Catalyst Sleeve (FBIO, RGNX):** This portion of the portfolio is geared toward near-term FDA decision events with asymmetric payoffs. We consciously let go of AQST post-bad news – a reaffirmation of our discipline to cut losing theses swiftly. What remains are two uncorrelated biotech bets. **Fortress Biotech (FBIO)** addresses a *rare pediatric disease (Menkes)* with a *small-molecule enzyme replacement*; the outcome (due within days) could yield a tradeable FDA voucher and a re-rating of the stock[\[3\]](https://www.fortressbiotech.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/729/fortress-biotech-and-cyprium-therapeutics-announce-fda#:~:text=Pursuant%20to%20the%20transaction%20with,and%20sales%20milestones%20from%20Sentynl). **REGENXBIO (RGNX)** targets a completely different arena: *gene therapy for a lysosomal disorder (Hunter syndrome)*, with a decision in early February[\[16\]](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regenxbio-announces-fda-review-extension-of-bla-for-rgx-121-to-treat-patients-with-mps-ii-302532620.html#:~:text=clemidsogene%20lanparvovec%20%28RGX,2025%20to%20February%208%2C%202026). The independent nature of these plays means one result shouldn’t impact the other (success or failure in one doesn’t read into the other’s science or regulatory odds). We’ve sized each bet such that even a total failure (e.g., CRL) would knock a few percent off the portfolio at most, while success could add double-digits in gains. This sleeve remains the primary engine for our potential outperformance – it’s where we take measured risks for outsized alpha. By mid-February, both catalysts will have resolved; our plan is to **“harvest and rotate”**: take profits on any wins and cut any losses quickly. Notably, our prior biotech winners (ATRA, etc.) contributed to a strong Sharpe ratio【user context】; we aim to keep that risk-adjusted performance high by ensuring no single biotech outcome can cripple us. The lesson from AQST’s setback was one we anticipated – hence the modest sizing – and it validated our approach of spreading risk across multiple events. As we move forward, we’ll continue to seek new biotech opportunities (or other sectors) to replace those that hit or miss, maintaining the momentum of this sleeve.

2. **Clean Tech/Value Sleeve (HDSN, AMTX):** The other half of the portfolio provides balance – these are companies with tangible assets and cash flows, benefiting from secular trends (climate initiatives, renewable energy) and company-specific catalysts of a fundamental nature. **Hudson Technologies (HDSN)** remains our steady compounder. It’s profitable, trading at a reasonable multiple, and could surprise the market with continued earnings beats or additional buybacks. We see it as a low-volatility anchor; indeed, since inception it has helped dampen our portfolio’s swings. The thesis is unchanged: as regulations force the phase-out of certain refrigerants, Hudson’s reclamation services are in higher demand, supporting earnings and cash that can be used for shareholder returns[\[4\]](https://www.hudsontech.com/category/financial-results-earnings-calls/#:~:text=HUDSON%20TECHNOLOGIES%20REPORTS%20THIRD%20QUARTER,0%20million%3B%20gross%20margin)[\[5\]](https://www.hudsontech.com/press-releases/hudson-technologies-board-of-directors-approves-increase-in-share-repurchase-authorization/#:~:text=Hudson%20may%20now%20purchase%20up,million%20of%20outstanding%20common). We’ll watch for any industry news, but expect a slow-and-steady trajectory. **Aemetis (AMTX)** is our more aggressive value play, but grounded in a real business pivoting toward profitability. The catalysts here are incremental – quarterly results showing narrowing losses, off-take agreements for renewable fuels, or additional government incentive monetization (which we already saw evidence of in December with the $17M credit sale[\[6\]](https://www.aemetis.com/aemetis-receives-funds-from-the-sale-of-17-million-of-federal-clean-energy-tax-credits/#:~:text=,30%2C%202025%20%E2%80%93%20Aemetis%2C%20Inc)). This week’s market action showed AMTX can react strongly to such news, as it did with a sharp rally on the tax credit funds receipt. We foresee a re-rating over 2026 as the market wakes up to Aemetis’s improving financials, but we’re also cognizant that patience is required (and thus we manage position size and use stops to contain risk). Together, HDSN and AMTX act as a counterweight to the binary biotech bets – they have their own catalysts (earnings, policy, contracts) that are not timing-dependent like FDA dates, and they provide us exposure to the “real economy” decarbonization trend, which is uncorrelated to biotech trial outcomes. In weeks where biotech might be quiet or volatile, these positions could hold their value or even appreciate on their own merits, preserving capital.

**Overall Portfolio Outlook:** We have navigated through the first wave of January events by decisively removing a loser (AQST) and taking profits in others (Atara, etc., in prior weeks). As of Week 17, our portfolio equity (\~$355 pre-trades) still handily outperforms a passive S\&P 500 allocation of the same amount【user context】. The coming week is pivotal with Fortress’s FDA decision. This could be a make-or-break moment for our YTD performance: a win might propel our equity significantly higher (we’d likely surpass the $400 mark for the first time), while a loss will shave off some gains. We’ve insulated this risk by position sizing – a failure won’t derail us, as the portfolio would still be roughly flat to slightly up versus inception even in that scenario. Our max drawdown to date (\~-20.8% in late September)【user context】 is something we are determined not to exceed; the quick exit of AQST exemplifies that commitment. We expect **volatility** to remain elevated in the next few weeks (biotech events cause swings, and indeed our portfolio beta \> 2 reflects that【user context】). However, volatility in service of upside is welcome, as long as we cap the downside – which is exactly our strategy via stops and diversification. By the end of January, our aim is to have a significantly higher portfolio value if one or both biotech catalysts hit, or a roughly preserved capital base if they do not. In either case, we’ll rotate the portfolio’s composition for the back half of the experiment (Weeks 18–26) into the next set of opportunities (be it other biotechs with Q1/Q2 events, small-cap tech plays, or even holding more cash if nothing compelling arises).

In summary, our portfolio remains **concentrated but hedged**: we place bold bets on high-alpha situations (FBIO, RGNX) while maintaining solid positions in businesses with inherent value (HDSN, AMTX). Each holding has a clear catalyst or value proposition and an identified exit strategy (stop-loss or profit target). We’ve shown this week our willingness to act (selling AQST) when a thesis breaks, and we’ll continue that no-nonsense approach. The core philosophy endures – *seek outsized gains from our best ideas, but protect the downside at all times*. This balanced aggression should allow us to continue outperforming. As we head into Week 17’s trading, we’re confident in our prep work and ready to execute the plan, with contingency plans in place. By staying research-driven and emotionally detached (plans to sell on both success and failure are pre-set), we tilt the risk/reward in our favor. Now it’s about diligent monitoring and timely execution. We believe the portfolio is poised for another leg higher if things go our way, and well-fortified to weather any setbacks if they come.
