## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `trading_script.py` | Trading engine: portfolio processing (482-741), daily analytics (987-1330), weekend summary (1368-1517) |
| `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md` | Portfolio rules — read before every analysis session |
| `Start Your Own/daily_analysis_prompt.md` | Daily 6-section format + weekend directive questions |
| `Start Your Own/weekend_summary.md` | Weekend deep research prompt (updated by `make weekend`) |
| `inject_last_thesis.py` | Injects Week N-1 Summary into `<last_analyst_thesis>` block |
| `generate_pdf.py` | Converts weekly MD report to PDF using fpdf2 |
| `Start Your Own/Generate_Graph.py` | Portfolio vs S&P 500 benchmark visualization |
| `screener.py` | Quantitative screener: Finviz universe → yfinance signals → ranked watchlist |

## Commands

```bash
make daily      # Run trading script after 4 PM (Claude auto-analyzes output)
make screen     # Run quantitative screener (outputs watchlist CSV)
make weekend    # Run screener + weekend analysis workflow (Claude auto-triggers deep research)
make setup      # Create venv + install deps
make graph      # Generate performance chart
make clean      # Remove venv
```

**Setup note**: This project is on iCloud-synced Desktop — use `make setup` to create the `.nosync` venv automatically. See `.claude/docs/setup-guide.md` for full details and troubleshooting.

## Environment Variables

- `ASOF_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD` — override today's date for backtesting (`trading_script.py:56-59`)

## Portfolio Rules

Complete rules (universe, execution limits, risk control, sizing, exclusions) are in `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md`. Read before every analysis session.

## Daily Workflow

1. Tell Claude: `Run daily: <inputs>` after 4 PM EST (Claude pipes inputs and runs the script)
   - No changes: `Run daily: no changes`
   - With trades: `Run daily: inject $143.08, buy 17 REPL limit $7.05 stop $5.90/$5.80`
   - Selling: `Run daily: sell 8 RCKT at $5.11`
2. Claude auto-analyzes the XML output with live web search
3. Review recommendations; specify any trades in the next `Run daily:` command

**Note:** Always use `Run daily:` (not the `!` shell prefix on `make daily`) — Claude Code's `!` prefix does not support interactive stdin. Likewise, say `run weekend` (not `! make weekend`) so Claude asks the 4 session directive questions first, then runs `make weekend` with answers as CLI args (SECTOR, TIMING, RISK, POSITIONS).

## Current State

- **Complete**: **Screener Phase 2 — pre-registered factor study** (rules `6c28378`, raw results `02ddb4d`; `Experiment Details/Screener Factor Study — Phase 2.md`). 21 formation dates on 19 point-in-time universes. At 10 sessions `vol_ratio`, `low_vol`, `near_high`, `vol_5_50`, `squeeze`, `vs_sma50` pass; `mom20` (today's 40% weight) unproven; short/60-day momentum and own-history squeeze drop; **no timing modes — option 3 unsupported**; all gates confirmed. Diagnostics: skill mostly defensive (flags volatile losers, strongest when the median falls); `squeeze` = low volatility; volume the only direction-independent signal; top-15 edge <1pp/10 sessions. Daily 9/14: gap **+0.93%** (first re-based session)
- **In progress**: **Phase 3 awaiting go-ahead** — composite → equal-weight `low_vol`, `near_high`, `squeeze`, `vol_5_50`, `vol_ratio`, `vs_sma50` (`mom20` out); one mode; gates unchanged; record the old and deduplicated composites in each screen's history for Phase 4. ATRC stop raise to **$51.50 / $51.35** recommended, awaiting broker placement
- **Next**: **VTS ex-dividend 9/15** — check whether the broker cut the stop by $0.4375; the once-per-position restoration becomes eligible at the open (~$17.32 / $17.17 from the actual price). Pending: final 52-week readout (reconcile S&P +14.87% vs +14.59%); dividend cash (~$2.23 after withholding) lands 9/30 with no ledger entry path
