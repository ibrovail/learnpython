## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `trading_script.py` | Trading engine: portfolio processing (482-741), daily analytics (987-1330), weekend summary (1368-1517) |
| `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md` | Portfolio rules — read before every analysis session |
| `Start Your Own/daily_analysis_prompt.md` | Daily 6-section format + weekend directive questions |
| `Start Your Own/weekend_summary.md` | Weekend deep research prompt (updated by `make weekend`) |
| `inject_last_thesis.py` | Injects Week N-1 Summary into `<last_analyst_thesis>` block |
| `generate_pdf.py` | Converts weekly MD report to PDF using fpdf2 |
| `Start Your Own/Generate_Graph.py` | Portfolio vs S&P 500 benchmark visualization |
| `screener.py` | Quantitative screener: Finviz universe → yfinance signals → ranked watchlist |

## Commands

```bash
make daily      # Run trading script after 4 PM (Claude auto-analyzes output)
make screen     # Run quantitative screener (outputs watchlist CSV)
make weekend    # Run screener + weekend analysis workflow (Claude auto-triggers deep research)
make setup      # Create venv + install deps
make graph      # Generate performance chart
make clean      # Remove venv
```

**Setup note**: This project is on iCloud-synced Desktop — use `make setup` to create the `.nosync` venv automatically. See `.claude/docs/setup-guide.md` for full details and troubleshooting.

## Environment Variables

- `ASOF_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD` — override today's date for backtesting (`trading_script.py:56-59`)

## Portfolio Rules

Complete rules (universe, execution limits, risk control, sizing, exclusions) are in `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md`. Read before every analysis session.

## Daily Workflow

1. Tell Claude: `Run daily: <inputs>` after 4 PM EST (Claude pipes inputs and runs the script)
   - No changes: `Run daily: no changes`
   - With trades: `Run daily: inject $143.08, buy 17 REPL limit $7.05 stop $5.90/$5.80`
   - Selling: `Run daily: sell 8 RCKT at $5.11`
2. Claude auto-analyzes the XML output with live web search
3. Review recommendations; specify any trades in the next `Run daily:` command

**Note:** Always use `Run daily:` (not the `!` shell prefix on `make daily`) — Claude Code's `!` prefix does not support interactive stdin. Likewise, say `run weekend` (not `! make weekend`) so Claude asks the 4 session directive questions first, then runs `make weekend` with answers as CLI args (SECTOR, TIMING, RISK, POSITIONS).

## Current State

- **Complete**: **Screener Phase 3 live** — `composite_score` = equal-weighted ranks of `low_vol`, `near_high`, `squeeze`, `vol_5_50`, `vol_ratio`, `vs_sma50`; **20-day momentum no longer scored**; `composite_legacy` and `composite_dedup` saved with every screen for the Phase 4 out-of-sample test (`Experiment Details/Screener Factor Study — Phase 2.md`). **Daily 9/16 backfilled** — Wednesday had been missed
- **In progress**: **One position left.** ATRC 3 sh **+66.6%** ($57.14), stop **$53.40 / $53.25** (locks +55.7%, 1.75×ATR of room). Equity **$724.44**, cash **$553.02 (76.3%)**, **gap +0.14%**, regime RISK-OFF (IWM 3.94% below its 50-day, widening daily). Both other holdings stopped out on sector moves: **PAR 9/15 at $17.05** (−$22.00; restaurant-tech selloff), **VTS 9/16 at $17.69** (−$0.96; WTI −3.2%, plus ~$2.23 dividend due 9/30)
- **Next**: **9/17 daily after the 4 PM close** (pre-open Yahoo serves the prior bar — never run it early). Week 54 research must deploy ~$444 of idle cash under RISK-OFF (catalyst-driven only). Re-entry bans: PAR ~9/29, VTS ~9/30. **Open question**: `portfolio_rules.md` still defines momentum/technical plays by momentum, which Phase 2 found has no ranking skill. Pending: final 52-week readout (S&P +14.87% vs +14.59%)
