# Small-Cap Live Portfolio

An indefinite live process using Claude Code to manage a real-money **small-cap** stock portfolio
(market cap up to $5Bn), tracking alpha vs. the S&P 500. *Folder and file names still say
"Micro-Cap" / "chatgpt_" from the project's origins; they are kept because renaming breaks paths.* The fixed 52-week experiment closed at the
2026-09-11 close; there is no end date. Holding horizon is **40–60 trading sessions**.

| `Start Your Own/daily_analysis_prompt.md` | Daily 6-section format + weekend directive questions |
| `Start Your Own/weekend_summary.md` | Weekend deep research prompt (updated by `make weekend`) |
| `inject_last_thesis.py` | Injects Week N-1 Summary into `<last_analyst_thesis>` block |

## Commands

```bash
make daily      # Run trading script after 4 PM (Claude auto-analyzes output)
make screen     # Run quantitative screener (outputs watchlist CSV)
make trigger    # Is a full weekend report due? Ledger-only verdict, run before any question
make weekend    # Run screener + weekend analysis workflow (Claude auto-triggers deep research)
make setup      # Create venv + install deps
make graph      # Generate performance chart
make clean      # Remove venv
```

**Setup note**: This project is on iCloud-synced Desktop — use `make setup` to create the `.nosync` venv automatically. See `.claude/docs/setup-guide.md` for full details and troubleshooting.

## Environment Variables

- `ASOF_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD` — override today's date for backtesting (`trading_script.py:56-59`)

## Portfolio Rules

Complete rules (universe, execution limits, risk control, sizing, exclusions) are in `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md`. Read before every analysis session.

## Daily Workflow

1. Tell Claude: `Run daily: <inputs>` after 4 PM EST (Claude pipes inputs and runs the script)
   - No changes: `Run daily: no changes`
   - With trades: `Run daily: inject $143.08, buy 17 REPL limit $7.05 stop $5.90/$5.80`
   - Selling: `Run daily: sell 8 RCKT at $5.11`
   - Optional, any day: `Run daily: no changes, full review ATRC` — forces a full review of a holding
     the script marked LINE (holdings are reviewed by exception since 2026-09-19)
2. Claude auto-analyzes the XML output with live web search
3. Review recommendations; specify any trades in the next `Run daily:` command

**Note:** Always use `Run daily:` (not the `!` shell prefix on `make daily`) — Claude Code's `!` prefix does not support interactive stdin. Likewise, say `run weekend` (not `! make weekend`): Claude runs `make trigger` first; if a full report is due it asks one optional question (anything specific to research?) and runs `make weekend FOCUS="..."`; if not, it runs `make screen` and writes a short `Week N Monitor.md` note.

## Current State

- **Complete**: **Indefinite-system rules revision (9/17)** — horizon **40–60 sessions**; the
  trailing stop is the only **mechanical** exit (partials deleted); **binary-thesis entries
  prohibited**; risk-per-trade **2%**; **drawdown circuit breaker** (−20% de-risk / −30% cash, on
  the injection-neutral series from the re-based peak); driver cap 2 + sector cap 3; RISK-OFF
  capacity raised; weekend **report** is trigger-based while the **screen** stays weekly. Standing
  rules in `portfolio_rules.md`, reasons in `Experiment Details/Rules Amendment History.md`.
- **Complete**: **Phase 3.5** — on non-overlapping formation dates the composite clears t=2.0 at
  **no** horizon, and 20/40/60 sessions have too few independent observations for any verdict;
  effect sizes do rise with horizon. **Phase 4 (Dec) primary horizon = 20 sessions**; the
  40-session test waits for ~March 2027. Index changes are the fifth unexplained-move category.
- **In progress**: **One position** — ATRC 3 sh **+69.4%** ($58.10), stop **$55.27 / $55.12**
  (locks +61.1%, only **1.28×ATR** of room; restoration used 8/31, so it cannot be lowered).
  **Joins the S&P SmallCap 600 before Monday 9/21's open** — the +12.8% run since the 9/04
  announcement and Friday's 8.67M shares were index demand. **49 sessions held** (re-underwrite
  ~10/5). Equity **$727.32**, cash **$553.02 (76.0%)**, **gap −0.76%**, regime RISK-OFF.
- **Complete (9/19)**: review items adopted — **one weekend question** (R1); **two-stage research funnel**
  sized to the buys sought, spread across ranks/sectors/size, extending to ranks 51–100 (R3); **research log** of buys *and* passes via `log_research.py`
  (R4); stop **raise target 2.0×ATR**, 1.5× floor applies at placement (R5); **regime computed**
  by the script → `<market_regime>`, `regime_history.csv`, flip trigger (R7); **small-cap** label +
  size control for Phase 4 (R8). **Six-section report** replaces the ten (R2);
  the `weekly-portfolio-report` skill is **retired** (predates every rule; conflicts with four).
  **Dailies by exception** — `<holding_review>` marks FULL/LINE (R6); **regime ±1% band** — 17 → 7
  regime changes a year, same RISK-OFF share (D3). Nothing left under discussion.
- **Next**: **Week 54 weekend research — `make trigger` says DUE.** ATRC first: joins the S&P
  SmallCap 600 at Monday's open; any trim must pass the thesis-exit test (would it be bought today
  at this price?). Then deploy ~$444 under RISK-OFF capacity, and log every shortlisted name.
  Commit `regime_history.csv` and `research_log.csv` with the dailies. Re-entry bans: PAR ~9/29,
  VTS ~9/30.
