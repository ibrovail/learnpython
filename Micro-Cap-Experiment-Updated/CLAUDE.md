## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `trading_script.py` | Trading engine: portfolio processing (482-741), daily analytics (987-1330), weekend summary (1368-1517) |
| `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md` | Portfolio rules — read before every analysis session |
| `Start Your Own/daily_analysis_prompt.md` | Daily 6-section format + weekend directive questions |
| `Start Your Own/weekend_summary.md` | Weekend deep research prompt (updated by `make weekend`) |
| `inject_last_thesis.py` | Injects Week N-1 Summary into `<last_analyst_thesis>` block |
| `generate_pdf.py` | Converts weekly MD report to PDF using fpdf2 |
| `Start Your Own/Generate_Graph.py` | Portfolio vs S&P 500 benchmark visualization |
| `screener.py` | Quantitative screener: Finviz universe → yfinance signals → ranked watchlist |

## Commands

```bash
make daily      # Run trading script after 4 PM (Claude auto-analyzes output)
make screen     # Run quantitative screener (outputs watchlist CSV)
make weekend    # Run screener + weekend analysis workflow (Claude auto-triggers deep research)
make setup      # Create venv + install deps
make graph      # Generate performance chart
make clean      # Remove venv
```

**Setup note**: This project is on iCloud-synced Desktop — use `make setup` to create the `.nosync` venv automatically. See `.claude/docs/setup-guide.md` for full details and troubleshooting.

## Environment Variables

- `ASOF_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD` — override today's date for backtesting (`trading_script.py:56-59`)

## Portfolio Rules

Complete rules (universe, execution limits, risk control, sizing, exclusions) are in `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md`. Read before every analysis session.

## Daily Workflow

1. Tell Claude: `Run daily: <inputs>` after 4 PM EST (Claude pipes inputs and runs the script)
   - No changes: `Run daily: no changes`
   - With trades: `Run daily: inject $143.08, buy 17 REPL limit $7.05 stop $5.90/$5.80`
   - Selling: `Run daily: sell 8 RCKT at $5.11`
2. Claude auto-analyzes the XML output with live web search
3. Review recommendations; specify any trades in the next `Run daily:` command

**Note:** Always use `Run daily:` (not the `!` shell prefix on `make daily`) — Claude Code's `!` prefix does not support interactive stdin. Likewise, say `run weekend` (not `! make weekend`) so Claude asks the 4 session directive questions first, then runs `make weekend` with answers as CLI args (SECTOR, TIMING, RISK, POSITIONS).

## Current State

- **Complete**: Week 50 executed (8/24) — **WWW bought 3sh @ $21.10** (gapped to $21.20, under the $21.30 no-chase line, filled on the pullback; closed $20.87, −1.1%, Day-1 rule not triggered). **ATRC stop → $45.85/$45.70**, **PAR stop → $17.50/$17.35** applied via `--update-stops`. Three script fixes this week: **stop-detection float epsilon** (`_PRICE_EPS`), **`last_completed_session()`** (weekend gate demanded today's session pre-open), and **`_input()` EOF tolerance** (a short piped stdin aborted the run *after* the trade log was written but *before* the portfolio save, leaving the files inconsistent)
- **In progress**: Week 50 of 52, **5 positions** (PAR/TILE/ATRC/CADL/WWW), equity **$775.71**, cash $128.14 (16.5%, floor is $116.36); **gap +0.99%** — still ahead of the benchmark, down from +1.48% on 8/21; TWR alpha +7.29%. ATRC made a new 52-wk high ($49.88) on a day every benchmark fell; the PRV gate caught the **BTIG PT raise to $55** pre-market
- **Next**: ~3 weeks left, **no holding reports earnings before the end** — drift-and-stop management only. **TILE is the whipsaw risk** (stop $37.10 is 0.77×ATR below price after −1.72%; cannot be lowered). **CADL is the likeliest stop-out** (1.13×ATR). IWM is only +0.38% over its 50-day — one weak session flips the regime to RISK-OFF. Consumer Discretionary cap is full (TILE+WWW)
