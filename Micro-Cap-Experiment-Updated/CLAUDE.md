## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `trading_script.py` | Trading engine: portfolio processing (482-741), daily analytics (987-1330), weekend summary (1368-1517) |
| `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md` | Portfolio rules — read before every analysis session |
| `Start Your Own/daily_analysis_prompt.md` | Daily 6-section format + weekend directive questions |
| `Start Your Own/weekend_summary.md` | Weekend deep research prompt (updated by `make weekend`) |
| `inject_last_thesis.py` | Injects Week N-1 Summary into `<last_analyst_thesis>` block |
| `generate_pdf.py` | Converts weekly MD report to PDF using fpdf2 |
| `Start Your Own/Generate_Graph.py` | Portfolio vs S&P 500 benchmark visualization |
| `screener.py` | Quantitative screener: Finviz universe → yfinance signals → ranked watchlist |

## Commands

```bash
make daily      # Run trading script after 4 PM (Claude auto-analyzes output)
make screen     # Run quantitative screener (outputs watchlist CSV)
make weekend    # Run screener + weekend analysis workflow (Claude auto-triggers deep research)
make setup      # Create venv + install deps
make graph      # Generate performance chart
make clean      # Remove venv
```

**Setup note**: This project is on iCloud-synced Desktop — use `make setup` to create the `.nosync` venv automatically. See `.claude/docs/setup-guide.md` for full details and troubleshooting.

## Environment Variables

- `ASOF_DATE=YYYY-MM-DD` — override today's date for backtesting (`trading_script.py:56-59`)

## Portfolio Rules

Complete rules (universe, execution limits, risk control, sizing, exclusions) are in `Start Your Own/portfolio_rules.md`. Read before every analysis session.

## Daily Workflow

1. Tell Claude: `Run daily: <inputs>` after 4 PM EST (Claude pipes inputs and runs the script)
   - No changes: `Run daily: no changes`
   - With trades: `Run daily: inject $143.08, buy 17 REPL limit $7.05 stop $5.90/$5.80`
   - Selling: `Run daily: sell 8 RCKT at $5.11`
2. Claude auto-analyzes the XML output with live web search
3. Review recommendations; specify any trades in the next `Run daily:` command

**Note:** Always use `Run daily:` (not the `!` shell prefix on `make daily`) — Claude Code's `!` prefix does not support interactive stdin. Likewise, say `run weekend` (not `! make weekend`) so Claude asks the 4 session directive questions first, then runs `make weekend` with answers as CLI args (SECTOR, TIMING, RISK, POSITIONS).

## Current State

- **Complete**: Week 45 deep research (7/19, Neutral) — HOLD all 5, no orders (4 of 5 print within 10 sessions). Screener corruption fixed (7/20): Finviz fetch was doubling every ticker's first char (TTE=TotalEnergies masquerading as small-cap); screener.py now auto-repairs, validates identity vs yfinance price (>40% divergence drop), excludes CEFs/ADRs/units (`Country: USA` + keyword/suffix guards). Corrected watchlist has real candidates (HTLD/CADL/GPRE/XNCR) — hold decision stands on Neutral+gauntlet rationale
- **In progress**: Week 45 of 52, 5 positions (WKC/SHO/TDAY/TILE/ATRC); equity $715.91 (7/17), cash $177.29 (24.8%); gap (scoreboard) −4.4%, TWR alpha +0.77%; PHAT re-entry ban thru ~7/27
- **Next**: Thu 7/23 double print — ATRC (strip binary override within 1 day, +30% alert on beat; $30.50 stop on miss) + WKC (stop banks +25% on fade); TDAY earnings 7/30, TILE 7/31, SHO 8/6; SHO stop-raise trigger at $12; TDAY next raise on close >$8.86; IWM 50-day cushion ~1.1% (close below $290.80 freezes momentum entries)
